Purpose:
    - providing a thorough understanding of the characteristics of "Good First Issues" (GFIs) and an
      automatic approach in GFIs prediction to reduce the burden of project members and help newcomers
      easily onboard

    - This paper aims at providing an automatic labeling approach for GFIs to reduce the burden of
      developers and in the meanwhile help newcomers easily onboard


GFIs tend to be described with certain words, in better readability, with shorter and clear
descriptions, and with more code snippets
