XMP is an extremely interesting feature that allows tagging PDF files (amongst others) with automatically retrievable metadata in much the same way mp3-tags allow adding title/author/... information to mp3 music files. Actually JabRef exports the metadata not only to two XMP namespaces (Dublin Core and a custom JabRef namespace), but also to the PDF DocumentInformation Object.\n\nPractically from the beginning of the XMP-writing capabilities of JabRef, Christopher Oezbek had added _privacy filtering_ for the XMP-tagging of PDF-files with data from the bibtex-record, meaning that the user could define a list of fields (in Preferences->XMP metadata) which should _not_ be exported to the PDF file.  Unfortunately, the filtering was incomplete: jabref exports the metadata in three different forms, only one of which was originally filtered. In 2013 filtering was extended to both XMP namespaces, but JabRef still exported _all_ fields into the PDF DocumentInfo object. The two present commits correct this problem. The first (b45316f) prevents private fields from being exported to the PDF DocumentInfo. The second one more agressively erases these fields even if they already exist in the PDF document. \n\nThe deletion of existing fields might be debateable. It seems the right thing to do for fields clearly generated by JabRef (viz. those prefixed by \"jabref/\"), but there are four fields which might be of other origin (Author,Title,Subject and Keywords). Making a systematic exception for these four fields, i.e. not erasing them even if they are privacy filtered, is a bad idea and violates the principle of least surprise. This is why the second commit makes no exception. Deactivating the erasure for the four generic fields could however easily be added as an option in the XMP export preferences if it is judged important. The current behaviour has the advantage of reliably correcting PDF files previously tagged with a buggy privacy filtering.\n\nIf these commits are pulled into the master branch and confirmed to work, the bug #869 on the sourceforge tracker: \nhttps://sourceforge.net/p/jabref/bugs/869/\ncan be closed.", "NaN"], ["9", "Support FindFullText with ACS DOIs", "Peter Ansell", "ansell", "05/20/14, 12:53:43 PM", "Adds a FullTextFinder implementation to transform the ACS DOI redirect URLs to their PDF download equivalents.", "NaN"], ["10", "try to fix some obvious bugs about `groups`", null, "braindevices", "05/20/14, 12:55:20 PM", "Hi All,\nI just upgraded to 2.10 and I found some bugs immediately.\n1. in the right-click-menu there is no `move-to-group` but 2 `remove\nfrom group` instead.\n2.

The layout formatter feature is a bit hidden and it is unclear how many people really use this feature.\n2. The feature is complex to use\n3. Some of the formatters should be a) integrated as default auto formatters b) removed because they really don't make a lot of sense.\n4. Most license problems are caused by these classes.\n# List\n\n> - **Authors** : this formatter provides formatting options for the author and editor fields; for detailed information, see below. It deprecates a range of dedicated formatters provided in versions of JabRef prior to 2.7.\n> - **CreateBibORDFAuthors** : formats authors for according to the requirements of the Bibliographic Ontology (bibo).\n> - **CreateDocBookAuthors** : formats the author field in DocBook style.\n> - **CreateDocBookEditors** : formats the editor field in DocBook style.\n> - **CurrentDate**: outputs the current date. With no argument, this formatter outputs the current date and time in the format \"yyyy.MM.dd hh:mm:ss z\" (date, time and time zone). By giving a different format string as argument, the date format can be customized. E.g. \\format[CurrentDate]{yyyy.MM.dd} will give the date only, e.g. 2005.11.30.\n> - Default : takes a single argument, which serves as a default value. If the string to format is non-empty, it is output without changes. If it is empty, the default value is output. For instance, \\format[Default(unknown)]{\\year} will output the entry's year if set, and \"unknown\" if no year is set.\n> \n> **DOIStrip**: strips any prefixes from the DOI string.\n\nShould be automatically integrated as sensible default!\n\n> **DOICheck** : provides the full url for a DOI link.\n\nDOICheck as name makes no sense. Rename at least to DOILink.\n\n> - FileLink(filetype) : if no argument is given, this formatter outputs the first external file link encoded in the field. To work, the formatter must be supplied with the contents of the \"file\" field.\n>   This formatter takes the name of an external file type as an optional argument, specified in parentheses after the formatter name. For instance, \\format[FileLink(pdf)]{\\file} specifies pdf as an argument. When an argument is given, the formatter selects the first file link of the specified type. In the example, the path to the first PDF link will be output.\n> - FirstPage : returns the first page from the \"pages\" field, if set. For instance, if the pages field is set to \"345-360\" or \"345--360\", this formatter will return \"345\".\n> - FormatChars : This formatter converts LaTeX character sequences their equicalent unicode characters and removes other LaTeX commands without handling them.\n> - FormatPagesForHTML : replaces \"--\" with \"-\".\n> - FormatPagesForXML : replaces \"--\" with an XML en-dash.\n> - GetOpenOfficeType : returns the number used by the OpenOffice.org bibliography system (versions 1.x and 2.x) to denote the type of this entry.\n> - HTMLChars : replaces TeX-specific special characters (e.g. {^a} or {\\\"{o}}) with their HTML representations, and translates LaTeX commands \\emph, \\textit, \\textbf into HTML equivalents.\n> - HTMLParagraphs : interprets two consecutive newlines (e.g. \\n \\n) as the beginning of a new paragraph and creates paragraph-html-tags accordingly.\n> - IfPlural : outputs its first argument if the input field looks like an author list with two or more names, or its second argument otherwise. E.g. \\format[IfPlural(Eds.,Ed.)]{\\editor} will output \"Eds.\" if there is more than one editor, and \"Ed.\" if there is only one.\n> - JournalAbbreviator : The given input text is abbreviated according to the journal abbreviation lists. If no abbreviation for input is found (e.g. not in list or already abbreviated), the input will be returned unmodified. For instance, when using \\format[JournalAbbreviator]{\\journal}, \"Physical Review - Letters\" gets \"Phys. Rev. Lett.\"\n> - LastPage : returns the last page from the \"pages\" field, if set. For instance, if the pages field is set to \"345-360\" or \"345--360\", this formatter will return \"360\".\n> - NoSpaceBetweenAbbreviations : LayoutFormatter that removes the space between abbreviated First names. Example: J. R. R. Tolkien becomes J.R.R. Tolkien.\n> - NotFoundFormatter : Formatter used to signal that a formatter hasn't been found. This can be used for graceful degradation if a layout uses an undefined format.\n> - Number : outputs the 1-based sequence number of the current entry in the current export. This formatter can be used to make a numbered list of entries. The sequence number depends on the current entry's place in the current sort order, not on the number of calls to this formatter.\n> \n> **RemoveBrackets** : removes all curly brackets \"{\" or \"}\".\n\nThis just removes **all** brackets without checking for escape sequences or such, e.g. {.\n\n> **RemoveBracketsAddComma**: removes all curly brackets \"{\" or \"}\". The closing curly bracket is replaced by a comma.\n\nI don't see any use case where I want to do this.\n- RemoveLatexCommands : removes LaTeX commands like \\em, \\textbf, etc. If used together with HTMLChars or XMLChars, this formatter should be called last.\n\n> **RemoveTilde**: replaces the tilde character used in LaTeX as a non-breakable space by a regular space. Useful in combination with the NameFormatter discussed in the next section.\n> \n> **RemoveWhitespace**: removes all whitespace characters.\n\nWhere would this make any sense?\n\n> - Replace(regexp,replacewith) : does a regular expression replacement. To use this formatter, a two-part argument must be given. The parts are separated by a comma. To indicate the comma character, use an escape sequence: \\, \u00a0 The first part is the regular expression to search for. Remember that any commma character must be preceded by a backslash, and consequently a literal backslash must be written as a pair of backslashes. A description of Java regular expressions can be found at: \u00a0http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html \u00a0 The second part is the text to replace all matches with.\n> \n> **RisAuthors** : to be documented.\n> **RisKeywords** : to be documented.\n> **RisMonth** : to be documented.\n\n[Biblioscape](http://www.biblioscape.com/) formatter?\n\n> - RTFChars : replaces TeX-specific special characters (e.g. {^a} or {\\\"{o}}) with their RTF representations, and translates LaTeX commands \\emph, \\textit, \\textbf into RTF equivalents.\n> - ToLowerCase : turns all characters into lower case.\n> - ToUpperCase : turns all characters into upper case.\n> - WrapContent : This formatter outputs the input value after adding a prefix and a postfix, as long as the input value is non-empty. If the input value is empty, an empty string is output (the prefix and postfix are not output in this case). The formatter requires an argument containing the prefix and postix separated by a comma. To include the comma character in either, use an escape sequence (\\,).\n> - WrapFileLinks : See below.\n> - XMLChars : : replaces TeX-specific special\n>       characters (e.g. {^a} or {\\\"{o}}) with their XML\n>       representations.\n# Decisions", "NaN"], ["127", "Minor improvement in GoogleUrlCleaner #126", "Matthias Geiger", "matthiasgeiger", "08/27/15, 09:07:05 AM", "Fixes detection of domains such as google.co.uk / co.jp / etc. and moves test class to test folder.", "NaN"], ["128", "GoogleUrlCleaner: Add support for pasting using bound shortcut", "Matthias Geiger", "matthiasgeiger", "08/27/15, 12:50:32 PM", "NaN", "NaN"], ["137", "Unify and simplify GUI actions", "Matthias Geiger", "matthiasgeiger", "09/03/15, 10:15:57 AM", "- Using lambdas for the simpler actions\n- Some code cleanup\n- Extract String commands as String constants to Actions.java and use the constants in JabRefFrame, BasePanel and RightClickMenu\n- Use the constants already defined in KeyBinds to get KeyStrokes for the Actions (in JabRefFrame, BasePanel, EntryEditor and RightClickMenu)\n- 8e3ad9d: Remove Quickfix for [SF.net Bug #1277](https://sourceforge.net/p/jabref/bugs/1277/) and implement feature properly: Instead of Deactivating \"Show/Hide Toolbar\" when no database is open, the action has been move to JabRefFrame and works now even if no database is open.\n\nsee also #136 ", "NaN"], ["143", "Fix SF Bug #1285", "Matthias Geiger", "matthiasgeiger", "09/04/15, 07:43:42 AM", "Restores the cursor resp. \"caret\" position when a field is store during editing.\nThis fixes [SF.net bug #1285](http://sourceforge.net/p/jabref/bugs/1285/).\n\nTo be done: \n- Backport to dev_2.11\n- Ask for confirmation on SF.net and close the issue there.", "NaN"], ["146", "[WIP] New iconset", "Matthias Geiger", "matthiasgeiger", "10/12/15, 09:22:00 PM", "see #130 ", "NaN"], ["147", "Remove option to set custom icon theme", "Simon Harrer", "simonharrer", "09/09/15, 12:55:47 PM", "The setting of a custom icon theme is not available in the GUI.
