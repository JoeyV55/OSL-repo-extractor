XMP is an extremely interesting feature that allows tagging PDF files (amongst others) with automatically retrievable metadata in much the same way mp3-tags allow adding title/author/... information to mp3 music files. Actually JabRef exports the metadata not only to two XMP namespaces (Dublin Core and a custom JabRef namespace), but also to the PDF DocumentInformation Object.\n\nPractically from the beginning of the XMP-writing capabilities of JabRef, Christopher Oezbek had added _privacy filtering_ for the XMP-tagging of PDF-files with data from the bibtex-record, meaning that the user could define a list of fields (in Preferences->XMP metadata) which should _not_ be exported to the PDF file.  Unfortunately, the filtering was incomplete: jabref exports the metadata in three different forms, only one of which was originally filtered. In 2013 filtering was extended to both XMP namespaces, but JabRef still exported _all_ fields into the PDF DocumentInfo object. The two present commits correct this problem. The first (b45316f) prevents private fields from being exported to the PDF DocumentInfo. The second one more agressively erases these fields even if they already exist in the PDF document. \n\nThe deletion of existing fields might be debateable. It seems the right thing to do for fields clearly generated by JabRef (viz. those prefixed by \"jabref/\"), but there are four fields which might be of other origin (Author,Title,Subject and Keywords). Making a systematic exception for these four fields, i.e. not erasing them even if they are privacy filtered, is a bad idea and violates the principle of least surprise. This is why the second commit makes no exception. Deactivating the erasure for the four generic fields could however easily be added as an option in the XMP export preferences if it is judged important. The current behaviour has the advantage of reliably correcting PDF files previously tagged with a buggy privacy filtering.\n\nIf these commits are pulled into the master branch and confirmed to work, the bug #869 on the sourceforge tracker: \nhttps://sourceforge.net/p/jabref/bugs/869/\ncan be closed.", "NaN"], ["9", "Support FindFullText with ACS DOIs", "Peter Ansell", "ansell", "05/20/14, 12:53:43 PM", "Adds a FullTextFinder implementation to transform the ACS DOI redirect URLs to their PDF download equivalents.", "NaN"], ["10", "try to fix some obvious bugs about `groups`", null, "braindevices", "05/20/14, 12:55:20 PM", "Hi All,\nI just upgraded to 2.10 and I found some bugs immediately.\n1. in the right-click-menu there is no `move-to-group` but 2 `remove\nfrom group` instead.\n2.

The layout formatter feature is a bit hidden and it is unclear how many people really use this feature.\n2. The feature is complex to use\n3. Some of the formatters should be a) integrated as default auto formatters b) removed because they really don't make a lot of sense.\n4. Most license problems are caused by these classes.\n# List\n\n> - **Authors** : this formatter provides formatting options for the author and editor fields; for detailed information, see below. It deprecates a range of dedicated formatters provided in versions of JabRef prior to 2.7.\n> - **CreateBibORDFAuthors** : formats authors for according to the requirements of the Bibliographic Ontology (bibo).\n> - **CreateDocBookAuthors** : formats the author field in DocBook style.\n> - **CreateDocBookEditors** : formats the editor field in DocBook style.\n> - **CurrentDate**: outputs the current date. With no argument, this formatter outputs the current date and time in the format \"yyyy.MM.dd hh:mm:ss z\" (date, time and time zone). By giving a different format string as argument, the date format can be customized. E.g. \\format[CurrentDate]{yyyy.MM.dd} will give the date only, e.g. 2005.11.30.\n> - Default : takes a single argument, which serves as a default value. If the string to format is non-empty, it is output without changes. If it is empty, the default value is output. For instance, \\format[Default(unknown)]{\\year} will output the entry's year if set, and \"unknown\" if no year is set.\n> \n> **DOIStrip**: strips any prefixes from the DOI string.\n\nShould be automatically integrated as sensible default!\n\n> **DOICheck** : provides the full url for a DOI link.\n\nDOICheck as name makes no sense. Rename at least to DOILink.\n\n> - FileLink(filetype) : if no argument is given, this formatter outputs the first external file link encoded in the field. To work, the formatter must be supplied with the contents of the \"file\" field.\n>   This formatter takes the name of an external file type as an optional argument, specified in parentheses after the formatter name. For instance, \\format[FileLink(pdf)]{\\file} specifies pdf as an argument. When an argument is given, the formatter selects the first file link of the specified type. In the example, the path to the first PDF link will be output.\n> - FirstPage : returns the first page from the \"pages\" field, if set. For instance, if the pages field is set to \"345-360\" or \"345--360\", this formatter will return \"345\".\n> - FormatChars : This formatter converts LaTeX character sequences their equicalent unicode characters and removes other LaTeX commands without handling them.\n> - FormatPagesForHTML : replaces \"--\" with \"-\".\n> - FormatPagesForXML : replaces \"--\" with an XML en-dash.\n> - GetOpenOfficeType : returns the number used by the OpenOffice.org bibliography system (versions 1.x and 2.x) to denote the type of this entry.\n> - HTMLChars : replaces TeX-specific special characters (e.g. {^a} or {\\\"{o}}) with their HTML representations, and translates LaTeX commands \\emph, \\textit, \\textbf into HTML equivalents.\n> - HTMLParagraphs : interprets two consecutive newlines (e.g. \\n \\n) as the beginning of a new paragraph and creates paragraph-html-tags accordingly.\n> - IfPlural : outputs its first argument if the input field looks like an author list with two or more names, or its second argument otherwise. E.g. \\format[IfPlural(Eds.,Ed.)]{\\editor} will output \"Eds.\" if there is more than one editor, and \"Ed.\" if there is only one.\n> - JournalAbbreviator : The given input text is abbreviated according to the journal abbreviation lists. If no abbreviation for input is found (e.g. not in list or already abbreviated), the input will be returned unmodified. For instance, when using \\format[JournalAbbreviator]{\\journal}, \"Physical Review - Letters\" gets \"Phys. Rev. Lett.\"\n> - LastPage : returns the last page from the \"pages\" field, if set. For instance, if the pages field is set to \"345-360\" or \"345--360\", this formatter will return \"360\".\n> - NoSpaceBetweenAbbreviations : LayoutFormatter that removes the space between abbreviated First names. Example: J. R. R. Tolkien becomes J.R.R. Tolkien.\n> - NotFoundFormatter : Formatter used to signal that a formatter hasn't been found. This can be used for graceful degradation if a layout uses an undefined format.\n> - Number : outputs the 1-based sequence number of the current entry in the current export. This formatter can be used to make a numbered list of entries. The sequence number depends on the current entry's place in the current sort order, not on the number of calls to this formatter.\n> \n> **RemoveBrackets** : removes all curly brackets \"{\" or \"}\".\n\nThis just removes **all** brackets without checking for escape sequences or such, e.g. {.\n\n> **RemoveBracketsAddComma**: removes all curly brackets \"{\" or \"}\". The closing curly bracket is replaced by a comma.\n\nI don't see any use case where I want to do this.\n- RemoveLatexCommands : removes LaTeX commands like \\em, \\textbf, etc. If used together with HTMLChars or XMLChars, this formatter should be called last.\n\n> **RemoveTilde**: replaces the tilde character used in LaTeX as a non-breakable space by a regular space. Useful in combination with the NameFormatter discussed in the next section.\n> \n> **RemoveWhitespace**: removes all whitespace characters.\n\nWhere would this make any sense?\n\n> - Replace(regexp,replacewith) : does a regular expression replacement. To use this formatter, a two-part argument must be given. The parts are separated by a comma. To indicate the comma character, use an escape sequence: \\, \u00a0 The first part is the regular expression to search for. Remember that any commma character must be preceded by a backslash, and consequently a literal backslash must be written as a pair of backslashes. A description of Java regular expressions can be found at: \u00a0http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html \u00a0 The second part is the text to replace all matches with.\n> \n> **RisAuthors** : to be documented.\n> **RisKeywords** : to be documented.\n> **RisMonth** : to be documented.\n\n[Biblioscape](http://www.biblioscape.com/) formatter?\n\n> - RTFChars : replaces TeX-specific special characters (e.g. {^a} or {\\\"{o}}) with their RTF representations, and translates LaTeX commands \\emph, \\textit, \\textbf into RTF equivalents.\n> - ToLowerCase : turns all characters into lower case.\n> - ToUpperCase : turns all characters into upper case.\n> - WrapContent : This formatter outputs the input value after adding a prefix and a postfix, as long as the input value is non-empty. If the input value is empty, an empty string is output (the prefix and postfix are not output in this case). The formatter requires an argument containing the prefix and postix separated by a comma. To include the comma character in either, use an escape sequence (\\,).\n> - WrapFileLinks : See below.\n> - XMLChars : : replaces TeX-specific special\n>       characters (e.g. {^a} or {\\\"{o}}) with their XML\n>       representations.\n# Decisions", "NaN"], ["127", "Minor improvement in GoogleUrlCleaner #126", "Matthias Geiger", "matthiasgeiger", "08/27/15, 09:07:05 AM", "Fixes detection of domains such as google.co.uk / co.jp / etc. and moves test class to test folder.", "NaN"], ["128", "GoogleUrlCleaner: Add support for pasting using bound shortcut", "Matthias Geiger", "matthiasgeiger", "08/27/15, 12:50:32 PM", "NaN", "NaN"], ["137", "Unify and simplify GUI actions", "Matthias Geiger", "matthiasgeiger", "09/03/15, 10:15:57 AM", "- Using lambdas for the simpler actions\n- Some code cleanup\n- Extract String commands as String constants to Actions.java and use the constants in JabRefFrame, BasePanel and RightClickMenu\n- Use the constants already defined in KeyBinds to get KeyStrokes for the Actions (in JabRefFrame, BasePanel, EntryEditor and RightClickMenu)\n- 8e3ad9d: Remove Quickfix for [SF.net Bug #1277](https://sourceforge.net/p/jabref/bugs/1277/) and implement feature properly: Instead of Deactivating \"Show/Hide Toolbar\" when no database is open, the action has been move to JabRefFrame and works now even if no database is open.\n\nsee also #136 ", "NaN"], ["143", "Fix SF Bug #1285", "Matthias Geiger", "matthiasgeiger", "09/04/15, 07:43:42 AM", "Restores the cursor resp. \"caret\" position when a field is store during editing.\nThis fixes [SF.net bug #1285](http://sourceforge.net/p/jabref/bugs/1285/).\n\nTo be done: \n- Backport to dev_2.11\n- Ask for confirmation on SF.net and close the issue there.", "NaN"], ["146", "[WIP] New iconset", "Matthias Geiger", "matthiasgeiger", "10/12/15, 09:22:00 PM", "see #130 ", "NaN"], ["147", "Remove option to set custom icon theme", "Simon Harrer", "simonharrer", "09/09/15, 12:55:47 PM", "The setting of a custom icon theme is not available in the GUI.

The problem with this approach is that the parser has to know about the bibtex vs biblatex mode. The idea was to add an intermediate step:\nString (in Bibtex file) -> EntryClass (by parser) -> EntryType (by some factory using information from the preferences)\n- There is an enum `StandardEntryClass` holding all the standard types regardless of bibtex or biblatex (so article, mvbook, etc, all are there). To support also unknown entry types we have the class `NonStandardEntryClass`. So for example, parsing `@article{}` results in `class = StandardEntryClass.ARTICLE` while `@gibberish{}` yields `class = NonStandardEntryClass` with name `gibberish`. In this way the type information is stored in a relative convenient form (better then a string).\n\nThe idea of an enum implementing an interface was taken from the way java handles standard file locations. See [the oracle blog ](https://blogs.oracle.com/darcy/entry/enums_and_mixins) (or [another blog](http://blog.pengyifan.com/how-to-extend-enum-in-java/)).\n- The `EntryClass` does not know about required and optional fields.

I think it is now time for feedback on two aspects:\n1. the save action feature itself\n2. the look of the GUI\n\nRegarding 1.: Currently, any class implementing `net.sf.jabref.logic.formatter.Formatter` can be used as a save action and can be configured for a field of any non-null and non-empty name (so you can configure actions for your custom fields). That is quite flexible. It would be trivial to extend that to `net.sf.jabref.logic.cleanup.CleanupJob`. The problem with integrating cleanup actions is that a `CleanupJob` seems to represent a batch job of cleanups that are preconfigured for certain fields. It is generally not intended to execute a `CleanupJob` for a specific and selectable field. Hence, I am not sure if cleanups and save actions go well together. A downside of the current save action feature is that save actions cannot be undone (like the sorting feature).\n\nRegarding 2.: The GUI is functional, _not_ pretty. \n![save actions](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1515701/13051416/6695bd6e-d3f9-11e5-83f7-9629616b3ede.png)\nIt has a check box to enable or disable all actions, a set of controls for adding a new action, a list for displaying actions, and a button for deleting a selected action. Do you have suggestions for a better set of controls?\n\nFinally, the layout of the controls definitely needs improvement and for some reason the size of the controls increases when adding an action.

Please have a look at this class. Almost all other changes are a direct consequence of the edits made to the ImportFormat class. The biggest change is that the import method returns a `ParserResult` instead of a list of entries (in this way, metadata can also be imported and error messages are communicated more effectively instead of throwing IOExceptions). Moreover, the import method operates on a reader instead of an input stream in order to reduce some common code in all importers.\n-  Add method `importDatabase(Path file, Charset encoding)` to the importer interface which opens the file and passes the stream to the other import method.\n- The BibTexImporter overwrites this new import method and uses the logic from `OpenDatabaseAction.loadDatabase` to determine the encoding of the bib file.\n- Change OpenDatabaseAction to operate against the BibTex importer. \n- Remove get/set isCustomImporter: was not really used (just for sorting - now everything is alphabetical)\n- Empty entries are no longer imported (thus a few test had to be changed)\n\nRemark: The methods getExtension and getDescription are not implemented by almost any importer.

The 2 goals of this revision is to improve maneuverability through the keyboard and streamlining hotkeys. Some related hotkeys like for the side panes were scattered across the keyboard, so we grouped them together. You might be wondering what has changed, so have a look at them:\n- Change default key bindings (have a look at the table below)\n- Add a hotkey for creating a new technical report\n- Add a hotkey for opening the OpenOffice/LibreOffice pane\n- Add \u201cPrint preview\u201d to the right-click menu\n- Improve group pane maneuverability by making groups selectable by arrow keys \n- Improve main table maneuverability by making \u201cTAB\u201d jump to the next entry instead of the next cell, \u201cSHIFT+TAB\u201d selects the previous entry\n- Resize the \u201cchange key bindings\u201d dialog to 500x500\n\n| Keys - new | Keys - old | Function |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| F7 | alt + f | Automatically set file links |\n| F8 | ctrl + shift + F7 | Cleanup entries |\n| alt + 1 | ctrl + shift + E | Focus entry table |\n| alt + 2 | ctrl + F9 | Toggle entry/preview editor |\n| alt + 3 | ctrl + shift + G | Toggle groups |\n| alt + 4 | F5 | web search |\n| alt + 0 | - | Open Openoffice/LibreOffice connection |\n| ctrl + shift + F7 | ctrl + f4 | Synchronize file links |\n| ctrl + shift R | - | Technical report |\n| - | alt + P | Print entry preview |\n| - | ctrl + alt + T | Hide/show toolbar |\n| - | ctrl+P | Edit preamble |\n\nAs you can see we moved related functions together. \u201cF7\u201d is now affiliated with file links, hence we changed key bindings if they contained \u201cF7\u201d but weren\u2019t related to file links.\nAlso we moved all side panes together by changing them to \u201cALT+(1,2,3,4,0)\u201d. By doing so we hope to improve the accessibility, because now you don\u2019t have to remember all kinds of key combinations for side panes, only which number stands for your desired pane. On a side note: Open OpenOffice/LibreOffice connection was added to this family due to being a side pane.\nThe hotkey for \u201cEdit preamble\u201d was changed due to normally being the hotkey to print.\nThe new hotkey for \u201cNew technical report\u201d was requested by some users that use it frequently, so we added a key binding.\nWe removed the hotkey for \u201cHide/show toolbar\u201d due to being not of any imaginable use for users.\nWe removed the hotkey for \u201cPrint entry preview\u201d due to some conflicts with others and the fact that this function wasn\u2019t really used that often by users. But we didn\u2019t remove it completely, we added it to the right click menu.\nWe removed the hotkey for \"Edit preamble\" due to being a seldomly used action that doens't require a hotkey.\nWe resized the \u201cchange key bindings\u201d dialog due to being too small for some descriptions.\n\nFor questions about the functioning or suggestions for improvements please use the discussion forum.

We are studying UI listeners, in particular listeners that manage several widgets, like the following listener extracted from JabRef:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic void valueChanged(ListSelectionEvent evt) {\r\n    Object source = evt.getSource();\r\n    if (familyList.equals(source)) {\r\n        String family = familyList.getSelectedValue();\r\n        if (family != null) {\r\n            familyField.setText(family);\r\n        }\r\n    } else if (sizeList.equals(source)) {\r\n        String size = sizeList.getSelectedValue();\r\n        if (size != null) {\r\n            sizeField.setText(size);\r\n        }\r\n    } else if (styleList.equals(source)) {\r\n        String style = styleList.getSelectedValue();\r\n        if (style != null) {\r\n            styleField.setText(style);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    updatePreview();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn such listeners, the source widget is identified using if/switch statements. Thanks to empirical studies we have indications that such a practice has a negative impact on the code quality. We call UI listeners that control three or more widgets, Blob Listeners (see this PDF document for more details: https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01308625v2/document).\r\n\r\nWe identified in JabRef six instances of the Blob listener and for four of them we have a refactoring solution. This pull request (PR) removes these four Blob listeners by splitting them into atomic UI listeners (i.e. they manage a single widget). Each commit of this PR refers to one or two Blob listeners. We manually tested JabRef for any regression. The new code is less complex in terms of cyclomatic complexity (CC) and lines of code (LoC): the new code has -38 LoCs and -21 of CC on the refactored files (according to Sonar analyses).\r\n\r\n\r\nComplementary to this PR, we have several questions for the JabRef's developers:\r\n\r\n1/ Do you think that coding UI listeners that manage several widgets is a bad coding practice?\r\n\r\n\r\n2/ Do you think that the threshold of three or more widgets per listener relevant for characterising a Blob listener?\r\n\r\n\r\n3/ Do you think that the refactored code relevant to remove Blob listeners?\r\n\r\n\r\n4/ Do you have any idea of the reason of the presence of Blob listeners in your code?\r\nFor example, lack of programming experience? Lack of anonymous functions (aka lambdas) in Java 7 (and previous JDKs)?\r\n\r\n\r\n5/ We identified two Blob listener for which we do not have a refactoring solution:\r\nhttps://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/master/src/main/java/net/sf/jabref/gui/autocompleter/AutoCompleteListener.java#L70\r\nhttps://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/master/src/main/java/net/sf/jabref/gui/BasePanel.java#L1409\r\nDo you have any idea if these listener have to and can be refactored?\r\n\r\n\r\n6/ Do you have suggestions about other bad user interface coding practices? This can concern controllers, commands, GUIs, widgets, data bindings, GUI testing, etc. \r", "NaN"], ["2371", "Reenable more tests", "Stefan Kolb", "stefan-kolb", "12/22/16, 01:54:51 PM", "- [x] Corrections of wrong Bibtex serializations: I inverted the tests for the file field so they test if the fields are not changed for \\n and \\t.\r\n- [x] Edge case behavior: Not implemented right now and won't be as @lenhard says.

I fail to see the point in this additional level of indirection. The `Worker` interface is supposed to mark tasks that should not be executed on the EDT, but there is nothing in the interface to actually maintain that apart from a comment line. All code using the `Worker` depends on the object being a `Runnable`, the `Worker` aspect is basically ignored, as there is nothing to consider in the first place. \r\n\r\nInstead, there is class `AbstractWorker` which implements the `Worker` aka `Runnable` interface and actually does provide the support for executing the task off the EDT. `AbstractWorker` is the class that is actually used in most of the code and it works just as fine if you have it implement `Runnable` directly.\r\n\r\nTherefore, in the spirit of science, I suggest to apply Occam's razor and to use the simplest solution (remove the additional indirection of `Worker`).\r", "NaN"], ["2421", "Revert \"Replace calls of BibtexParser.parse\"", "Tobias Diez", "tobiasdiez", "12/22/16, 10:18:50 AM", "<!-- describe the changes you have made here: what, why, ... -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Change in CHANGELOG.md described\r\n- [ ] Tests created for changes\r\n- [ ] Screenshots added (for bigger UI changes)\r\n- [ ] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef\r\n- [ ] Check documentation status (Issue created for outdated help page at [help.jabref.org](https://github.com/JabRef/help.jabref.org/issues)?)\r\n- [ ] If you changed the localization: Did you run `gradle localizationUpdate`?\r", "NaN"], ["2422", "Replace parse", "Tobias Diez", "tobiasdiez", "12/22/16, 10:25:02 AM", "<!-- describe the changes you have made here: what, why, ... -->\r\nThis time I merge it the right way.

The problem is line 64 in MetaDataSerializer:\r\n```\r\n stringBuilder.append(StringUtil.quote(dataItem, MetaData.SEPARATOR_STRING, MetaData.ESCAPE_CHARACTER)).append(MetaData.SEPARATOR_STRING);\r\n```\r\nFor every MetaData item, all special characters are quoted, including the quoting symbol (`\\`). Thus, if there is a `\\` in the MetaData, it is quoted during serialization, resulting in `\\\\`, which is read as such and requoted on the next serialization, resulting in `\\\\\\\\` and so on. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, unquoting the text during parsing and quoting it again during writing does not help, since a single `\\` will simply be lost. E.g.: unquoting `\\\"U` would result in `\"U`, which upon quoting anew would stay `\"U`.\r\n\r\nThe same problem should occur for groups, if I am not mistaken.\r\n\r\nI now have the following options to resolve the problem:\r\n 1. Add special handling for content selectors to avoid quoting for them\r\n 2. Change `StringUtil.quote` to avoid quoting the quoting char (`\\`)\r\n 3. Add another method in StringUtil that avoids quoting the quoting char and use it for MetaData in general.\r\n\r\nI am afraid that changing `StringUtil.quote` has wider implications that I am not aware of., especially relating to groups Hence, there is a need for discussion. \r\n\r\n- [x] Change in CHANGELOG.md described\r\n- [x] Tests created for changes\r\n- [x] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef\r\n\r", "NaN"], ["2446", "Make icon colors (and size?!) configurable", "Matthias Geiger", "matthiasgeiger", "02/15/17, 03:00:25 PM", "Implementation of a [feature request at the forum](http://discourse.jabref.org/t/menu-and-buttons-with-a-dark-theme/405/3): Colors can be changed now in the \"Appearance\" preferences tab (see Screenshot).\r\n\r\nHowever, I think it would be useful to add the possibility to set the icon size, too.

This is also fixed.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n- [ ] Change in CHANGELOG.md described\r\n- [x] Tests created for changes\r\n- [ ] Screenshots added (for bigger UI changes)\r\n- [x] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef\r\n- [ ] Check documentation status (Issue created for outdated help page at [help.jabref.org](https://github.com/JabRef/help.jabref.org/issues)?)\r\n- [x] If you changed the localization: Did you run `gradle localizationUpdate`?\r", "NaN"], ["2564", "Remove groups edit mode", "Tobias Diez", "tobiasdiez", "02/21/17, 12:35:11 PM", "<!-- describe the changes you have made here: what, why, ... -->\r\n\r\nIn the edit mode, you were able to select a few entries and assign them to a group with a single click.\r\nAs I think that drag&drop and the special \"add to groups\" dialog provide sufficient facilities to add entries to groups, I hereby propose to remove this \"feature\".  \r\n\r\nResolves https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/1550.\r\n\r\n- [x] Change in CHANGELOG.md described\r\n- [ ] Tests created for changes\r\n- [ ] Screenshots added (for bigger UI changes)\r\n- [x] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef\r\n- [ ] Check documentation status (Issue created for outdated help page at [help.jabref.org](https://github.com/JabRef/help.jabref.org/issues)?)\r\n- [ ] If you changed the localization: Did you run `gradle localizationUpdate`?\r", "NaN"], ["2567", "Fix NPE on tab switching in EntryEditor between Mr Dlib", "Christoph", "Siedlerchr", "02/20/17, 09:34:49 AM", " and File Annotations\r\nAdjust formatting\r\n\r\n<!-- describe the changes you have made here: what, why, ... -->\r\n\r\n~~- [ ] Change in CHANGELOG.md described~~\r\n~~- [ ] Tests created for changes~~\r\n~~- [ ] Screenshots added (for bigger UI changes)~~\r\n- [X] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef\r\n~~- [ ] Check documentation status (Issue created for outdated help page at [help.jabref.org]~~(https://github.com/JabRef/help.jabref.org/issues)?)\r\n~~- [ ] If you changed the localization: Did you run `gradle localizationUpdate`?~~\r", "NaN"], ["2568", "Fix medline fetcher test", "Christoph", "Siedlerchr", "02/18/17, 10:48:03 PM", "Add missing/changed fields to fix test\r\n\r\nAs this entry seems to be published now, I don't  expected it to change further...", "NaN"], ["2569", "More safely delete files", "Stefan Kolb", "stefan-kolb", "02/21/17, 11:44:21 AM", "See #245\r\n\r\n- confirmation before file deletion\r\n- change language strings so the user knows this action is permanent", "NaN"], ["2575", "Check similarity of entry when using DOI retrieval with ArXiV", "Stefan Kolb", "stefan-kolb", "02/21/17, 06:02:56 PM", "Resolves #2570", "NaN"], ["2576", "Add logic for new Sciencedirect pages", "Stefan Kolb", "stefan-kolb", "02/21/17, 05:55:55 PM", "Fixes #2574", "NaN"], ["2578", "Fix failng tets (Medline,  ISBN, L10N)", "Christoph", "Siedlerchr", "02/21/17, 03:48:43 PM", "Revised date changed ", "NaN"], ["2579", "Update IEEEJournalList", "Patrick Storz", "Ede123", "02/22/17, 09:41:18 PM", "Update for `IEEEJournalListCode.txt` and `IEEEJournalListText.txt` compiled from [IEEEfull.bib](http://tug.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/IEEEtran/bibtex/IEEEfull.bib) and [IEEEabrv.bib](http://tug.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/IEEEtran/bibtex/IEEEabrv.bib) respectively.", "NaN"], ["2582", "Localization tests", "Stefan Kolb", "stefan-kolb", "02/22/17, 10:02:23 PM", "Test for #1985", "NaN"], ["2583", "Keyword - Special field synchronization", "Stefan Kolb", "stefan-kolb", "02/22/17, 05:24:44 PM", "Fixes #2580 \r\nSynch should now work appropriately.\r\n\r\nFew questions here @koppor and all others:\r\n\r\n- [x] If keyword sync is enabled, there is the possibility that we have multiple `rank1, rank4` keywords.\r\nOnly the first one is synched with the special field.

If we want fewer events, the only solution will probably be to break the binding, which would be very disappointing for the JavaFX implementation. In my point of view the problem is not on the side of event creation. After all, every change should trigger an event and JavaFX triggers many changes.

In detail, when `EntryEditor` opens up, it is not focused automatically. The desired behavior is to focus the first `Textfield` on any of the `EntryEditor`'s tabs.\r\n\r\nThe way the fix is implemented: when `EntryEditor` is opened, the `JFXPanel` in which is the `TabPane` of the `EntryEditor` is getting the focus, The focus is given implicitly to a focusTraversable node contained in the `JFXPanel`. The selection of the node seems to be \"random\" (even though consistent for a given tree of nodes).

This PR avoids that. Instead of recreating a new entry editor, the existing one is reused and just all its contents, i.e. the tabs, are recreated.

Here's an overview\r\n![jabref](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1515701/29995805-2524954c-8ff2-11e7-8e96-76e7e3b030c0.png)\r\nThe peaks are from cycling through the main table with down key pressed, but as we can see garbage collection still reduces the used heap massively.\r\n\r\nThe next step (in a new PR) would be to avoid a recreation of the tabs and to implement a proper lazy initialization of them, so that they only consume memory and processing power when they are actually visible.\r\n\r\nI've tested it manually and hope that this doesn't add hidden bugs. After all, the tabs are still created anew so there shouldn't be update problems. Nevertheless, this should receive some manual testing from someone else before it is merged. Lastly, since the tabs are created anew there's now a visible effect when selecting a new entry: The new tabs sort of \"fly in\". I have no problems with that, but if others find that annoying then this PR should not yet be merged before for 4.0 or alternatively only when the tabs are not recreated.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Change in CHANGELOG.md described\r\n- [ ] Tests created for changes\r\n- [ ] Screenshots added (for bigger UI changes)\r\n- [X] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef\r\n- [ ] Check documentation status (Issue created for outdated help page at [help.jabref.org](https://github.com/JabRef/help.jabref.org/issues)?)\r\n- [ ] If you changed the localization: Did you run `gradle localizationUpdate`?\r", "NaN"], ["3188", "Added check for existing files when renaming linked file", "Andrew", "Andrew-Lev", "09/12/17, 02:58:12 AM", "#3172 Added a check in LinkedFileViewModel.rename() to see if a file which is\r\nbeing renamed already exists in the target location.

It is now possible to use bracketed expressions (like \"[bibtexkey]\" or \"[year]\\_[auth]\\_[firstpage]\") consistently in:\r\n\r\n- BibTex key generator patterns;\r\n- File search regular expressions (for automatic file linking);\r\n- Import file name patterns;\r\n- Import directory patterns.\r\n\r\nTo maintain consistent formatting, I have created a new BracketedExpressionExpander class which provides its main methods, 'expandBrackets()'. They essentially contain all bracket expansion functionality moved from BibtexKeyPatternUtil, and the BibtexKeyPatternUtil class now extends BracketedExpressionExpander, and uses its static methods. The BracketedExpressionExpander is also used in FileUtil and RegExpBasedFileFinder, avoiding the previous duplication of functionality in BibtexKeyPatternUtil.makeLabel(...) and RegExpBasedFileFinder.getFieldAndFormat(...) methods (both now use BracketedExpressionExpander.expandBrackets() for dealing with *all* aspects of bracket expansion in one place).\r\n\r\nThe bracketed expressions now can be used for Import File name patterns and Import File Directory patterns, providing consistent behavior of all \"pattern\" tabs in the JabRef \"Preferences\" dialogue; it is also possible to use underscores in the Import File and Directory patterns (e.g. \"[year]\\_[auth]\\_[pages]\") and to place Import destination directories deeper in the tree (e.g. \"by-author/[authIni1]/[auth]\" Directory Pattern now works as expected, creating \"by-author/P/Pezzotti/2013\\_Pezzotti\\_211301.pdf\" for the reference: Pezzotti, G. Raman spectroscopy of piezoelectrics Journal of Applied Physics, 2013, 113, 211301).\r\n\r\nTo retain functionality that was previously implemented by the '\\entrytype' Layout pattern, a new bracketed expression \"[entrytype]\" was created and tested. It is suggested that Layout manager is used exclusively for describing layouts in citation lists, and bracketed expressions are used for describing file system and database entry patterns.\r\n\r\nThe functionality was tested under LinuxMint 18.1 and Ubuntu 16.04. Unfortunately, I could not test it on Windows hosts since I do not have any of them available for Java testing. I have put in provisions to deal with both '/' and '\\' directory separators in Directory Patterns, but I would be grateful if someone checks them on a Windows system.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nSaulius", "NaN"], ["3240", "Use only last name for auto completion in search bar", "Tobias Diez", "tobiasdiez", "09/29/17, 06:24:40 AM", "Now only the last name of the author is added (and shown as a suggestion) to the search bar.

To provide a reasonable implementation and not only a bugfix I had to change the layout. These things bothered me the most:\r\n\r\n- `LocalizationBundle` and `Localization` were calling each other. We needed `Localization` to create the keys in the bundle and on the other hand, the `LocalizationBundle` was only used in the `Localization` class\r\n- `Localization` seemed like a quick fix to provide messages as bundle to Java FX\r\n- On each call to any function in these classes, the unescaping of messages was done again. This, in particular, was the reason why showed up as hot spot in the profiler\r\n\r\nTo unify the implementation, I based the complete `Localization` framework on two instances (menus and messages) of `LocalizationBundle` and made this an internal class as it should not be used without it. The bundles are (re)created when `setLanguage` is called and contain the unescaped keys and messages for the specified language as a fast hash table.\r\n\r\nThis enables two things: (1) We can pass the `LocalizationBundle` instance directly to Java FX with `getMessages` and since we only pass the reference to the hash table, it will be instantaneous. (2) Every call to `lang` or `menuTitle` is a simple lookup in the hash table and a replacement of possible parameters in the string.\r\n\r\nThe public API for `Localization`, meaning `lang`, `menuTitle`, `getMessages` and `setLanguage` did not change and works as expected. During profiling/debugging I noticed, however, that there is a flaw in the JabRef startup. The language is set after the initialization of the preferences. At least one preference setting uses a localized string in a static field. Since when uninitialized, the `Localization` reverts back to \"en\", these strings will never be in the user language (see [this issue](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/3326)). Furthermore, due to this access, the `Localization` framework will always be initialized several times. Once in the init of the preferences and once further down in `main`.\r\n\r\nThis can only be fixed by pushing `setLanguage` to the initialization of the preferences which I did. One additional minor thing was that one message key was used escaped and had to be unescaped. Other than that, this implementation worked out of the box and passed all existing localization tests.\r\n\r\nI commented my code heavily and would be glad if someone would review it.

The reasoning is simple: Currently, all editor tabs (extending from `FieldsEditorTab`) are initialized when a new entry is selected. So even if the user is only browsing through the entry table with the editor open, on each new BibEntry we create all the tabs for each entry from scratch. This can in the case of `FieldsEditorTab` simply prevented by moving this initialization to `initialize` which is called when the tab gets focus. This PR addresses this issue.\r\n\r\nI want to give a detailed analysis because there is much more potential when we slightly rework how the `EntryEditor` and its tabs work. First of all, this is the memory increase when I scroll the 209 entry example `jabref-authors.bib` with the current master branch.\r\n\r\n![img](http://i.imgur.com/tt99OZf.png)\r\n\r\nIn the middle I start after running the GC with about 140MB and after scrolling the list, I ended up with 1.9GB. 99% of this comes directly from the `EntryEditor`. After the patch I propose, the memory situation is vastly improved\r\n\r\n![img](http://i.imgur.com/AhRSD0E.png)\r\n\r\nWe need less than 400MB at the peaks and the GC seems to be able to do a much better job. It's not only an improvement in memory, but the performance increases dramatically.\r\n\r\n## Where to go from here?\r\n\r\nThese things should be fixed in a next step:\r\n\r\n1. `org.jabref.gui.entryeditor.EntryEditor#addTabs` is the major hotspot now because it recreates all tabs on a new entry.\r\n2. ensure that all tabs get this late initialization on focus.\r\n3. tabs should not be recreated at all, they should be kept as objects in `EntryEditor` and only get notified when a new entry is selected.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I don't see that I can do this on my own without breaking some of the various information flows on updates in the tabs (esp. the source tab). But if someone started to work on this I would join. These are the things I would change first:\r\n\r\n1. almost all tabs get `frame, panel, entryType, this, entry` on construction. This needs to go away. `EntryEditor` is an instance of `EntryContainer` and tabs can get the current entry. We need similar things for the other parameters. In essences, it should be `new EntryEditorTab(entryEditorInstance)`.\r\n2. On `initialize` the tab should check if it is initialized and if the entry has changed\r\n3. The entryEditor has a list of *all* tabs that are created on construction and it only notifies them on entry change.\r\n\r\n### The \"sliding tab problem\"\r\n\r\nEspecially with this faster version, the problem of the tabs sliding in from the left on recreation becomes more visible. I have no simple solution to this especially since I'm not sure how many tabs there theoretically can be. It's these line in `addTabs`\r\n\r\n```\r\n        // General fields from preferences\r\n        EntryEditorTabList tabList = Globals.prefs.getEntryEditorTabList();\r\n        for (int i = 0; i < tabList.getTabCount(); i++) {\r\n            FieldsEditorTab newFieldsEditorTab = new FieldsEditorTab(frame, panel, tabList.getTabFields(i), this, false,\r\n                    false, entry);\r\n            newFieldsEditorTab.setText(tabList.getTabName(i));\r\n            tabs.add(newFieldsEditorTab);\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we have a reasonable number of tabs, the best and clearest solution would be to just disable the ones that should not be shown. This will give a fixed EntryEditor layout that works nice, but I'm not sure it would piss user of if they have to endure disabled tabs.\r\n\r\nThe second solution would be to maintain a list of all tabs and one with the currently visible tabs (`tabbed.getTabs()`). This will again lead to a wiggling tabs header, but not as bad as before. On entry change, we just modify `tabbed` to display correct tabs.\r\n\r\nThe third solution would be to simply close tabs programmatically but that interferes with the current `TabClosingPolicy.UNAVAILABLE`", "NaN"], ["3332", "Disable travis email notifications about build status", "Tobias Diez", "tobiasdiez", "10/24/17, 09:36:19 AM", "<!-- describe the changes you have made here: what, why, ... -->\r\n\r\nThese constant notifications whether a PR-build was successful or not are getting on my nerves.

This has an impact on performance and memory and, unfortunately, it is not only a tiny fraction. \r\n\r\n## Memory\r\n\r\nNotable are the columns \"Objects\", which are all objects that are created by this method and underlying sub calls and the overall \"Size\".\r\n\r\n![mem1](http://i.imgur.com/pjBJSlF.png)\r\n\r\nWith almost 40% of the overall memory size, it's definitely something to look into.\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n\r\nThe performance is with 8% not so large but still noticeable. \r\n\r\n![perf1](http://i.imgur.com/STSGgNj.png)\r\n\r\n## Fixing it\r\n\r\nBy using the `Supplier` interface, we can move the instantiation to the point where the user actually right-clicks into the field. I debugged this, and it seems to work nice. The outcome was as expected. Since no one actually triggers the context menu by just browsing through the list, it vanished altogether. Here is the used memory with this PR created by exactly scrolling through the 50 entries. First the memory footprint\r\n\r\n![mem2](http://i.imgur.com/dRrKaxs.png)\r\n\r\nand here the performance impact\r\n\r\n![perf2](http://i.imgur.com/HgJNhLl.png)\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, this means as long as the user doesn't need a context menu, we have no memory or performance impact at all.\r\n\r\n## Note\r\n\r\nI updated the `checkstyle` version in the Gradle built. I like to write comments, and now it doesn't prevent me any longer from using `{@link ...}` in doc-comments to classes that are otherwise not used.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Change in CHANGELOG.md described\r\n- [ ] Tests created for changes\r\n- [ ] Screenshots added (for bigger UI changes)\r\n- [x ] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef\r\n- [ ] Check documentation status (Issue created for outdated help page at [help.jabref.org](https://github.com/JabRef/help.jabref.org/issues)?)\r\n- [ ] If you changed the localization: Did you run `gradle localizationUpdate`?\r", "NaN"], ["3343", "Fix NPE when calling with bib file as cmd argument", "Christoph", "Siedlerchr", "10/24/17, 06:55:46 PM", "Fixes #3342, follow up issue from #3325 \r\nUse toAbsolutePath before calling of getParent\r\n\r\n<!-- describe the changes you have made here: what, why, ... -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Change in CHANGELOG.md described\r\n- [ ] Tests created for changes\r\n- [ ] Screenshots added (for bigger UI changes)\r\n- [x] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef\r\n- [ ] Check documentation status (Issue created for outdated help page at [help.jabref.org](https://github.com/JabRef/help.jabref.org/issues)?)\r\n- [ ] If you changed the localization: Did you run `gradle localizationUpdate`?\r", "NaN"], ["3348", "Updating with new translations", "Igor Steinmacher", "igorsteinmacher", "10/26/17, 12:37:29 AM", "Updated the entries with no translations.

This of course means that I tried not to introduce bugs (although I'm sure there will be small glitches) but it also implies that I didn't improved the code too much.

The problem was that updates to the editor were not performed on the javafx thread although they were wraped in a `runInJavaFXThread` call. The reason was that this method would actually submit tasks to the executor, which would then start a new thread.

Since `localizationUpdate` seems broken, the messages are currently not added and I'm waiting for the fix.The logic behind the java check is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. In `gradle.build` we can define the `minRequiredJavaVersion` which is added as a value to `build.properties` as this was the most fitting place and it makes the version check quite flexible. I did not use an upper bound for the version but a boolean `allowJava9` indicator. The reasoning behind it is that a developer who is actually working on the Java 9 support just has to change this value to make JabRef start.\r\n2. I put the version check as a method into `BuildInfo`. Other possible places would be `Globals` or when we give the build-info as a parameter then `JavaVersionCheck` itself. Suggestions?\r\n3. The version check is called pretty early in `main` (as soon as localization is set up). I didn't bother to put the single error dialog into a separate class. Therefore, the logic of checking, showing the message and probably exiting is done directly there. Is this acceptable?\r\n\r\nThe version check itself has the only requirement to successfully access `System.getProperty(\"java.version\")`. I implemented a very *optimistic* check that doesn't fail if we cannot determine or compare the versions. Only if we are sure that the used version is not sufficient, it will fail.\r\n\r\nThis will solve\r\nhttps://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/3310\r", "NaN"], ["3420", "Backport of syncLang to python2", "Linus Dietz", "LinusDietz", "11/09/17, 02:10:44 PM", "fixes #3414,\r\n\r\nmakes https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/3415 obsolete...", "NaN"], ["3421", "[WIP] First attempt for JDK11 compilation - #Java11", "Christoph", "Siedlerchr", "08/25/19, 03:26:13 PM", "This addresses https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/2594.\r\n\r\nI played around a bit with the jigsaw module stuff.\r\nDoes not yet compile complete, but it's a step in the right direction.\r\nIf anyone is interested in this stuff, please move ahead. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- describe the changes you have made here: what, why, ... -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Change in CHANGELOG.md described\r\n- [ ] Tests created for changes\r\n- [ ] Screenshots added (for bigger UI changes)\r\n- [ ] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef\r\n- [ ] Check documentation status (Issue created for outdated help page at [help.jabref.org](https://github.com/JabRef/help.jabref.org/issues)?)\r\n- [ ] If you changed the localization: Did you run `gradle localizationUpdate`?\r", "NaN"], ["3422", "Fix #3411: ordering of fields in customized entry types works again", "Tobias Diez", "tobiasdiez", "11/10/17, 12:41:14 AM", "<!-- describe the changes you have made here: what, why, ... -->\r\n\r\nmerge if test passes since it is only a very minor code change.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Change in CHANGELOG.md described\r\n- [ ] Tests created for changes\r\n- [ ] Screenshots added (for bigger UI changes)\r\n- [ ] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef\r\n- [ ] Check documentation status (Issue created for outdated help page at [help.jabref.org](https://github.com/JabRef/help.jabref.org/issues)?)\r\n- [ ] If you changed the localization: Did you run `gradle localizationUpdate`?\r", "NaN"], ["3424", "Fix test for quoted lang messages", "Patrick Scheibe", "halirutan", "11/10/17, 09:24:35 AM", "Fix for https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/3397\r\n\r\n(I made some newlines in the `findMissingLocalizationKeys` so that they can be better seen in the console)\r\n\r\n- [ ] Change in CHANGELOG.md described\r\n- [x] Tests created for changes\r\n- [ ] Screenshots added (for bigger UI changes)\r\n- [x] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef\r\n- [ ] Check documentation status (Issue created for outdated help page at [help.jabref.org](https://github.com/JabRef/help.jabref.org/issues)?)\r\n- [ ] If you changed the localization: Did you run `gradle localizationUpdate`?\r", "NaN"], ["3425", "[WIP] Java9 support", "Oliver Kopp", "koppor", "11/22/17, 09:35:10 AM", "This is an initial shot to get Java9 working.\r\n\r\n- [x] Addresses `java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: javax/xml/bind/JAXBException` with the solution posted at https://stackoverflow.com/a/43574427/873282.\r\n- [ ] \"module config stuff\" https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/2594#issuecomment-333849933\r\n- [ ] Update https://github.com/JabRef/org.jabref.gui.customjfx.support\r\n- [ ] Update libraries https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/2594#issuecomment-331638433\r\n- [ ] make a jar which combines both customfx 8 and customfx 9 - see https://groups.google.com/d/msg/controlsfx-dev/PDAqhp0YfHo/Qld6EEwBAgAJ\r\n- [ ] CircleCI update to compile using oraclejdk9 - see <https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/wiki/CI> for our general CI strategy", "NaN"], ["3427", "Rework entry editor toolbar in JavaFX", "Tobias Diez", "tobiasdiez", "12/28/17, 03:56:27 PM", "<!-- describe the changes you have made here: what, why, ... -->\r\n\r\nSince quite some time passed since the last issue was created concerning the entry editor, I feel like this component is getting way to stable and no longer annoys users.

I moved the search.rules.describer package like proposed from the logic package to the gui package. The existing tests were moved accordingly but still needs to be rewritten for the new TextFlow results.\r\n\r\nThere are some open questions i would like to ask:\r\n\r\n1. With no Styling of the Tooltip, the readability was really bad (black text on grey background), so I changed the styling to look like the other Tooltips in the bar. Hope it was okay to do this in the context of this issue? I created a new styleclass for this in the Main.css to not change any other styled elements.\r\n2. the [SearchQuery](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/master/src/main/java/org/jabref/logic/search/SearchQuery.java) class stores a description of the search. It is created with the SearchDescribers. But they are now inside the gui package and return a TextFlow. So there is a javafx dependency in the SearchQuery class which resides in the logic package at the moment. This doesnt sound right to me? Should the class be moved to the gui package too?\r\n3. The [GroupDialog](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/master/src/main/java/org/jabref/gui/groups/GroupDialog.java) class uses a SearchQuery object to get a search description. This class is written with Swing and is not compatible to the now returned TextFlow. If I understand it right, the project is migrating to use javaFX. So I want to propose that I write a compatibility method in the GroupDialog class to create an HTML string from the given TextFlow to be compatible while the GroupDialog is still using Swing. \r\n4. Sadly the localized strings used in the SearchDescribers included the HTML tag elements.. So in many cases it is not possible to use existing translations.. just because the tags are gone. I'm not sure what to do about this. It could be possible to remove the tags manually from the translations. Not sure how long this would take..\r\n\r\nThat's how the tooltip looks with the changes:\r\n![screenshot-2017-11-18--13 15 28](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4948016/32980197-9c017e62-cc62-11e7-86a6-b5c0c0010ac8.png)\r\n\r\nThere seems to be something wrong with the logic of the tooltip text creation, the first few words repeat itself. And it already happened prior to my changes (see the image in #3381) But I didnt had time to look very closely into this. Should I open a new issue for this problem?\r\n\r\nI hope I didn't forget anything.

So far the code is only a prototype, but it already works really well. What is missing is that changes in the aux file are automatically recognized and handled (this should be easy to accomplish). The user interface is very very basic and only contains a text field where the user can specify the path to the aux file (in light of the upcoming rewrite of the groups dialog in javafx #2643, I don't want to spent to much time at ui stuff). \r\n\r\nI have two questions:\r\n- ~~The implementation so far is against our architecture.

Unfortunately, we also use libraries that make such internal accesses and we need to find a solution for that.\r\n\r\nOne of these libraries is swingx. Originally by Sun, it is no longer maintained since quite a while we could not even upgrade to the newest version, because of bugs in the library. It is time to get rid of this dependency. This PR replaces the usage of swingx with regular Swing components. Only the new entries dialog and the side pane are affected. For the new entries dialog, the change is trivial (just using a regular layout manager). For the side pane, a few changes are needed, but I can make it roughly resemble the old layout. \r\n\r\nThere's one bigger change, though, that I happen to like very much: The side panes are no longer exclusive, you can display them together.

Might be fixed by #3684 \r\n- [x] Changes to entries don't mark database as changed.\r\n- [x] File annotation tab is not shown and throws exception https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/3621#issuecomment-361647223\r\n- [x] Paste of new entries does not work\r\n- [x] It is no longer possible to select multiple entries by holding mouse button: [code to fix](https://community.oracle.com/thread/2621389)\r\n\r\nChangelog:\r\n--\r\nFixed:\r\n- Italic text is now rendered correctly. https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/3356\r\n- The entry editor no longer gets corrupted after using the source tab. https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/3532 https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/3608 https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/3616\r\n- We fixed multiple issues where entries did not show up after import if a search was active. https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/1513 https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/3219\r\n- We fixed an issue where the group tree was not updated correctly after an entry was changed. https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/3618\r\n- We fixed an issue where a right-click in the main table selected a wrong entry. https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/3267\r\n- We fixed an issue where in rare cases entries where overlayed in the main table. https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/3281\r\n- We fixed an issue where selecting a group messed up the focus of the main table / entry editor. https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/3367\r\n- We fixed an issue where composite author names were sorted incorrectly. https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/2828\r\n- We fixed an issue where the custom file column were sorted incorrectly. https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/3119\r\n- We fixed an issues where the entry losses focus when a field is edited and at the same time used for sorting. https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/3373\r\n- We fixed an issue where the menu on Mac OS was not displayed in the usual Mac-specific way. https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/3146\r\n- We fixed an issue where the groups tree of the last database was still shown even after the database was already closed.\r\n- We fixed an issue where the \"Open file dialog\" may disappear behind other windows. https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/3410\r\n- We fixed an issue where the default icon of a group was not colored correctly.\r\n- We reworked the \"Edit file\" dialog to make it resizeable and improved the workflow for adding and editing files https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/2970\r\n- We fixed an issue where the month was not shown in the preview https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/3239.\r\n\r\nChanged:\r\n- The special fields like `Printed` and `Read status` now show gray icons when the row is hovered.\r\n- We added a button in the tab header which allows you to close the database with one click. https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/494\r\n- Sorting in the main table now takes information from cross-referenced entries into account. https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/2808\r\n- If a group has a color specified, then entries matched by this group have a small colored bar in front of them in the main table.\r\n- Change default icon for groups to a circle because a colored version of the old icon was hard to distinguish from its black counterpart.\r\n- In the main table, the context menu appears now when you press the \"context menu\" button on the keyboard. [feature request in the forum](http://discourse.jabref.org/t/how-to-enable-keyboard-context-key-windows)\r\n- We added icons to the group side panel to quickly switch between `union` and `intersection` group view mode https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/3269\r\n\r\nRemoved:\r\n- The feature to \"mark entries\" was removed and merged with the groups functionality.  For migration, a group is created for every value of the `__markedentry` field and the entry is added to this group.\r\n- The number column was removed.\r\n- We removed the coloring of cells in the maintable according to whether the field is optional/required.\r\n- We removed a few commands from the right-click menu that are not needed often and thus don't need to be placed that prominently:\r\n  - Print entry preview: available through entry preview\r\n  - All commands related to marking: marking is not yet reimplemented\r\n  - Set/clear/append/rename fields: available through Edit menu\r\n  - Manage keywords: available through Edit menu\r\n  - Copy linked files to folder:  available through File menu\r\n  \r\nMigrated features:\r\n- [x] Sorting (Shift + click for multi-column sort)\r\n- [x] Filtering by search and groups \r\n- [x] Context menu (with linked files) for the file icon\r\n- [x] Right-click menu\r\n- [x] Setting special fields like reading status / priority / ... through the main table\r\n  \r\nI would like to ask all contributors with write-access to complete the lists above (with links to a comment with further details if necessary) with new bugs or missing features as they are discovered.", "NaN"], ["3623", "Fix ErrorProne errors", "Oliver Kopp", "koppor", "01/10/18, 09:53:05 AM", "This fixes\r\n\r\n```\r\n/home/ubuntu/jabref/src/main/java/org/jabref/logic/citationstyle/CitationStyle.java:156: error: [StreamResourceLeak] Streams that encapsulate a closeable resource should be closed using try-with-resources\r\n                List<Path> allStyles = Files.find(jarFs.getRootDirectories().iterator().next(), 1, (file, attr) -> file.toString().endsWith(\"csl\")).collect(Collectors.toList());\r\n                                                 ^\r\n    (see http://errorprone.info/bugpattern/StreamResourceLeak)\r\n  Did you mean 'List<Path> allStyles ;'?\r\nNote: Some input files use or override a deprecated API.\r\nNote: Recompile with -Xlint:deprecation for details.\r\nNote: Some input files use unchecked or unsafe operations.\r\nNote: Recompile with -Xlint:unchecked for details.\r\n1 error\r\n```\r", "NaN"], ["3624", "Add installation directory to Java version error message", "Tobias Diez", "tobiasdiez", "01/10/18, 09:54:11 AM", "<!-- describe the changes you have made here: what, why, ... -->\r\n\r\nTriggered by [discussion in the forum](http://discourse.jabref.org/t/java-error-on-jabref/974).\r\nBuild fails because I'm not sure whether I should add the empty translations to the other languages or not. @koppor ?!\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n- [ ] Change in CHANGELOG.md described (not worth)\r\n- [ ] Tests created for changes\r\n- [ ] Screenshots added (for bigger UI changes)\r\n- [ ] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef\r\n- [ ] Check documentation status (Issue created for outdated help page at [help.jabref.org](https://github.com/JabRef/help.jabref.org/issues)?)\r\n- [ ] If you changed the localization: Did you run `gradle localizationUpdate`?\r", "NaN"], ["3627", "New Crowdin translations", "Oliver Kopp", "koppor", "01/11/18, 04:05:03 PM", "Enjoy!", "NaN"], ["3630", "Add gitter badge", "Oliver Kopp", "koppor", "01/12/18, 03:56:23 PM", "This addresses https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/3586\r\n\r\nIn the DevCall, we decided, that we will try to use Gitter and see how it goes.\r\n\r\nThe main arguments were:\r\n- easy to join for new users\r\n- offer help for new developers since the burden of initial JabRef development is high for newcomers - even if we have https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/wiki/High-Level-Documentation and https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/wiki/Code-Howtos\r\n- Nearly none of the developers uses Slack\r\n- does not clutter the Skype chat of the developers\r\n- developers can use [pinned tabs](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/pinned-tabs-keep-favorite-websites-open) to keep gitter always opened\r\n\r\nWe will shutdown gitter in case there won't be much support from @JabRef/developers there (because lack of time).
