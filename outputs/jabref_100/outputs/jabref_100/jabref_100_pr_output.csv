8PDF-file metadata: Privacy Filtering all metadataAdrian Daerradaerr04/23/14, 09:23:03 PM"This pull-request pertains to the addition of metadata to PDF files associated with entries, as triggered by the menu entry ""Write XMP metadata to PDFs"" in the ""Tools"" menu. XMP is an extremely interesting feature that allows tagging PDF files (amongst others) with automatically retrievable metadata in much the same way mp3-tags allow adding title/author/... information to mp3 music files. Actually JabRef exports the metadata not only to two XMP namespaces (Dublin Core and a custom JabRef namespace), but also to the PDF DocumentInformation Object.

Practically from the beginning of the XMP-writing capabilities of JabRef, Christopher Oezbek had added _privacy filtering_ for the XMP-tagging of PDF-files with data from the bibtex-record, meaning that the user could define a list of fields (in Preferences->XMP metadata) which should _not_ be exported to the PDF file.  Unfortunately, the filtering was incomplete: jabref exports the metadata in three different forms, only one of which was originally filtered. In 2013 filtering was extended to both XMP namespaces, but JabRef still exported _all_ fields into the PDF DocumentInfo object. The two present commits correct this problem. The first (b45316f) prevents private fields from being exported to the PDF DocumentInfo. The second one more agressively erases these fields even if they already exist in the PDF document. 

The deletion of existing fields might be debateable. It seems the right thing to do for fields clearly generated by JabRef (viz. those prefixed by ""jabref/""), but there are four fields which might be of other origin (Author,Title,Subject and Keywords). Making a systematic exception for these four fields, i.e. not erasing them even if they are privacy filtered, is a bad idea and violates the principle of least surprise. This is why the second commit makes no exception. Deactivating the erasure for the four generic fields could however easily be added as an option in the XMP export preferences if it is judged important. The current behaviour has the advantage of reliably correcting PDF files previously tagged with a buggy privacy filtering.

If these commits are pulled into the master branch and confirmed to work, the bug #869 on the sourceforge tracker: 
https://sourceforge.net/p/jabref/bugs/869/
can be closed.""thx!

10try to fix some obvious bugs about `groups`braindevices05/20/14, 12:55:20 PM"Hi All,
I just upgraded to 2.10 and I found some bugs immediately.
1. in the right-click-menu there is no `move-to-group` but 2 `remove
from group` instead.
2. I like the new add/remove/move panel, but the scrolling is not
working, which is a big problem. Because I have lots of groups which
cannot even fit into the full screen height after expansion.
3. no way to expand or collapse all nodes

I tried the dev version, all problems still exist. Here is my fixation.

Cheers,

W.L.""After 2.10 the BibtexEntryType.java is changed a lot. The optional fields and required fields are very different. If one need the field order is exactly the same as the 2.9.2, one should manually define the order. 2.10 also fixes some bugs in entry sorting. Some entries will be always different from 2.9.2. So I think backward-compatibility does not make sense any more. If one really want the bib file arranged in the same way as 2.9.2, he should just use 2.9.2. Upgrade all client to 2.10 makes more sense here.

The fix for the BibtexEntry can be accepted immediately. 

However, JabRef is currently targeting Java 7, while you made use of classes from Java 8 in CleanUpAction. Hence, this part of the pull request cannot be accepted at this point in time.

Is it wise to include Joda time? Or should this be done with the old and antique class Calendar? @koppor 
 =||= I think a workaround with the old Calendar class is way more complicated since the day-part is optional and as much as I know about the old time classes such situations are hard to handle.
On the other hand, I think the feature in CleanUpAction is not that important and useful for other users and could be skipped as long as Jabref targets Java 7 (it was morally a feature to repair the damage caused by the bug in BibtexEntry).

In the creation of the menu item in the 'JabRefFrame' class for the item 'Open folder', it was not possible to recover the value of the item in the list 'defKeyBinds', occurring error 'NullPointerException' in the 'String makeEscape (String s) 'method in 'JabRefPreferences' class, which shouldnt return the value of 'String' to fill out the menu item.
When the 'User' tried to change and save the list, the error 'NullPointerException' not allow the execution of the procedure.
To solve the bug , was included in the verification of the presence of null in 'keyBinds' list (copy of 'defKeyBinds'), the value 'Not associated' being passed to the 'String' return.
The warning that menu feature is created in the 'JabRefFrame' class without associated keyboard shortcut, was moved to the method mentioned before, as was duplicated.""Thanks for the PR.

40Fix for bug #876: Windows 7/8/10 - Pinning Jabref to the taskbarTobias Dieztobiasdiez05/11/15, 04:15:52 PM"Previously, JabRef couldn't be pinned to the taskbar ([bug report](https://sourceforge.net/p/jabref/bugs/876/)). The reason is that, by wrapping JabRef with Launch4j, Windows thinks only Java is running and does not recognize JabRef as something separate.

Based on a [stackoverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9330209/whats-the-best-way-to-start-java-applications-on-windows-7) the fix proceeds in two stages:
- During the setup, we create a (dummy) shortcut and set the [Application User Model Id](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd378459%28v=vs.85%29.aspx). For this, we use the [WinShell plugin](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/WinShell_plug-in) for NSIS.
- At program start, we notify Windows that this JabRef instance has the AppUserModelId specified in the setup. In order to do this, we invoke native commands using the Java Native Access (JNA) library. ""Thank you for the pull request. My issue is that it includes commits not being related with the fix. The typical way of creating pull requests is to have a separate branch for each pull request. So we can discuss each improvement separately.

The comment is very useful. However, it would be better to place it in the commit message to have it stored in the git repository, too. We have an initial code documentation at https://sourceforge.net/p/jabref/wiki/Development_Howtos/, but I think, that is the wrong place for that.
 =||= I see your point! The other git commits just revert some local changes so that I'm in sync with your repository. All changes in ""Files changed"" are needed for this fix. 
Since I'm new to git, I would welcome if you could provide me tips how I can now remove the unnecessary commits and add the above description to the commit message. Thanks.
