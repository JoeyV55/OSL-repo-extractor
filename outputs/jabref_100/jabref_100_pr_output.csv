8PDF-file metadata: Privacy Filtering all metadataAdrian Daerradaerr04/23/14, 09:23:03 PM"This pull-request pertains to the addition of metadata to PDF files associated with entries, as triggered by the menu entry ""Write XMP metadata to PDFs"" in the ""Tools"" menu. XMP is an extremely interesting feature that allows tagging PDF files (amongst others) with automatically retrievable metadata in much the same way mp3-tags allow adding title/author/... information to mp3 music files. Actually JabRef exports the metadata not only to two XMP namespaces (Dublin Core and a custom JabRef namespace), but also to the PDF DocumentInformation Object.

Practically from the beginning of the XMP-writing capabilities of JabRef, Christopher Oezbek had added _privacy filtering_ for the XMP-tagging of PDF-files with data from the bibtex-record, meaning that the user could define a list of fields (in Preferences->XMP metadata) which should _not_ be exported to the PDF file.  Unfortunately, the filtering was incomplete: jabref exports the metadata in three different forms, only one of which was originally filtered. In 2013 filtering was extended to both XMP namespaces, but JabRef still exported _all_ fields into the PDF DocumentInfo object. The two present commits correct this problem. The first (b45316f) prevents private fields from being exported to the PDF DocumentInfo. The second one more agressively erases these fields even if they already exist in the PDF document. 

The deletion of existing fields might be debateable. It seems the right thing to do for fields clearly generated by JabRef (viz. those prefixed by ""jabref/""), but there are four fields which might be of other origin (Author,Title,Subject and Keywords). Making a systematic exception for these four fields, i.e. not erasing them even if they are privacy filtered, is a bad idea and violates the principle of least surprise. This is why the second commit makes no exception. Deactivating the erasure for the four generic fields could however easily be added as an option in the XMP export preferences if it is judged important. The current behaviour has the advantage of reliably correcting PDF files previously tagged with a buggy privacy filtering.

If these commits are pulled into the master branch and confirmed to work, the bug #869 on the sourceforge tracker: 
https://sourceforge.net/p/jabref/bugs/869/
can be closed.""thx!

10try to fix some obvious bugs about `groups`braindevices05/20/14, 12:55:20 PM"Hi All,
I just upgraded to 2.10 and I found some bugs immediately.
1. in the right-click-menu there is no `move-to-group` but 2 `remove
from group` instead.
2. I like the new add/remove/move panel, but the scrolling is not
working, which is a big problem. Because I have lots of groups which
cannot even fit into the full screen height after expansion.
3. no way to expand or collapse all nodes

I tried the dev version, all problems still exist. Here is my fixation.

Cheers,

W.L.""After 2.10 the BibtexEntryType.java is changed a lot. The optional fields and required fields are very different. If one need the field order is exactly the same as the 2.9.2, one should manually define the order. 2.10 also fixes some bugs in entry sorting. Some entries will be always different from 2.9.2. So I think backward-compatibility does not make sense any more. If one really want the bib file arranged in the same way as 2.9.2, he should just use 2.9.2. Upgrade all client to 2.10 makes more sense here.

The fix for the BibtexEntry can be accepted immediately. 

However, JabRef is currently targeting Java 7, while you made use of classes from Java 8 in CleanUpAction. Hence, this part of the pull request cannot be accepted at this point in time.

Is it wise to include Joda time? Or should this be done with the old and antique class Calendar? @koppor 
 =||= I think a workaround with the old Calendar class is way more complicated since the day-part is optional and as much as I know about the old time classes such situations are hard to handle.
On the other hand, I think the feature in CleanUpAction is not that important and useful for other users and could be skipped as long as Jabref targets Java 7 (it was morally a feature to repair the damage caused by the bug in BibtexEntry).

When the 'User' tried to change and save the list, the error 'NullPointerException' not allow the execution of the procedure.
To solve the bug , was included in the verification of the presence of null in 'keyBinds' list (copy of 'defKeyBinds'), the value 'Not associated' being passed to the 'String' return.

Sent from my Android device with K-9 Mail. Please excuse my brevity.
 =||= Ok, I will add an option to toggle the gridlines on and off. Originally, I also planned to add alternating background colors to better distinguish between rows. However, since JabRef also allows for marking entries, I doubt that this is a good approach. 
 =||= ## I think you're right about the background colours. It could easily collide with marked entries.

Sent from my Android device with K-9 Mail. Please excuse my brevity.
 =||= Also I am not a Java programmer (and may be because I am not...), I 
believe it may not be difficult to add some gray to every five lines to 
whatever is the color of the background (while, yellow, orange, red).

58Fixed typo that prevented ant buildsnikmilpv06/21/15, 11:29:27 AMNaN"What do you mean by ""prevent ant builds""? Even with the patch, `ant jars` outputs `Compile failed; see the compiler error output for details.`, because the compiler cannot find certain packages.

`gradlew antTargets.release` runs through even without the patch.

`Apache Ant(TM) version 1.9.5 compiled on May 31 2015`. Which version do you have, what is your output?
 =||= I'm building on Linux. Without the patch, both `./gradlew antTargets.jars` and `./gradlew antTargets.release.linux` fail, because the compiler can't find the dependencies. On the other hand, `./gradlew generateSource` and `./gradlew jar` run fine.

After some digging around, I found that paths in `configurations.compile.asPath` are separated by `:` instead of `;` -- at least on Linux, don't know if that's the case on other platforms.

I haven't tried `ant jars` and I doubt it would work, because the paths to dependencies are now passed through gradle.

It uses an additional `.mailmap` file to merge different name/email configurations of unique authors.
The list is in sync with the old manual list from `About.html`.
Missing manual entries are concatenated in `scripts/generate-authors.sh`for now.

Imho, we should either skip missing authors, or map them to unmapped commit emails.
I'm not sure how many commits are missing in our history and in which way these people contributed.
Maybe @koppor can shed some light on this.

The idea is to use this file to replace our contributors list inside `About.html` automatically without losing contributor's information or being inconsistent between languages etc.
We may have to do some changes to the file structure, e.g. attribute _name_ only, but this PR is mainly for unifying our data first.

The script itself `scripts/generate-authors.sh` can either be included in the build process or executed manually at times, as it may be beneficial if we oversee the mapping process by a human.""@stefan-kolb The thing is that the old version control system used before was Subversion, which does not support the difference between author and committer. [JabRef switched to git in November, 2011](http://osdir.com/ml/java-jabref-devel/2011-11/msg00006.html). That means, all commits before November 2011 may have wrong author information. Furthermore, after November 2011 not all patches have been applied using `--author`.
 =||= Also, is the author list generation script automatically part of JabRef's build procedure? In that case, it could exclude most Windows users? 
 =||= @ThomasA It is not (yet?) part of the build procedure. Even if it was Windows users should be able to run it with Cygwin or MSYS.
 =||= I was just thinking that if this is the only shell-dependent step in 
building JabRef, it might be a major nuisance to anyone on Windows if 
they would have to install and build in Cygwin just for this. This could 
potentially disrupt the workflow of most Windows contributors.
I am just speculating here. I don't know how many Windows contributors 
there are and I am using Linux myself.
 =||= I do not think that this is an issue because when having git installed locally on windows, there must at the moment be also the basic unix tools available as well because git relies upon them. (I am a windows developer)

But this stirrs up another interesting question. The previous scripts that were used to generate the homepage pages out of the authors were written in perl, which is yet another dependency. And we have python scripts in the repository as well. Maybe we should just use a single scripting language for all the scripts to reduce the learning overhead?
 =||= OK, I just wanted to make sure this issue was considered.
As for a unifying scripting language, I highly favour Python but then 
again, I hardly contribute to JabRef nowadays.
 =||= Of course, using a single scripting language will make the maintenance easier.
I suggest to define a preferred scripting language for _future development_.

About existing scripts: I believe to rewrite all of them is not a high priority for JabRef development. Maybe conversion of the critical ones (which are to be identified).

88Improve Mac OS X buildingOliver Koppkoppor01/26/16, 07:49:23 PM"Currently, our MacAdapter class depends on `com.apple.*`. These classes are not available on a Linux or Windows JDK. Our current solution is to include [the legacy AppleJavaExtensions](https://developer.apple.com/legacy/library/samplecode/AppleJavaExtensions/Introduction/Intro.html), which are not available on jCenter. Another option is to use the [OrangeExtensions](http://ymasory.github.io/OrangeExtensions/). However, we use `com.apple.eawt.FullScreenUtilities`, which is not available.

We should get support of FullScreenUtilities into the OrangeExtensions and switch to them to get rid of AppleJavaExtensions.jar in the source repository.""The project OrangeExtensions seems to be unmaintained with pull requests open since 2013. See https://github.com/ymasory/OrangeExtensions

May be we need to switch back to the .class file which is loaded dynamically?
 =||= I propose to create a fork and take over the development lead of the OrangeExtensions. @stefan-kolb WDYT?
 =||= It's hard to give a definitive answer for me, as I'm not using OSX. In my opinion we need someone who actively uses OSX and can test/evaluate more on this topic.

As far as I can tell Apple dropped the native support for its Apple-specific Java runtime.
[1] https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/releasenotes/Java/JavaSnowLeopardUpdate3LeopardUpdate8RN/NewandNoteworthy/NewandNoteworthy.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010380-CH4-SW1
[2] http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24479016/how-to-get-apple-java-extensions-com-apple-eawt-work-on-jdk-7-and-higher
[3] http://alvinalexander.com/java/java-mac-osx-about-preferences-quit-application-adapter

However, we are only using custom events for AboutHandler, OpenFile, Preferences and Quit.
I'm unsure how we should use and implement these stuff with newer OSX versions or if we already got it right. Official documentation seems hard to find. For me, this also makes it uncertain if we are going for the right approach with the OrangeExtension Stubs.

Anyway, I think the switch to JavaFX will help tremendously in the effort of OS unification.

 =||= Hm. You intentionally waive compatibility, just to achieve a code saving of a handful lines? Or speeding up the application start?

It is clear what you loose, but what do you want to gain with this removal?
 =||= The current master branch is intended to be a major rewrite. 
Version 1.55 dates back to 2004/11 (if this code is only for 1.55).
Quite a few things will probably break in the transition to JabRef v3.
We try to get rid of a lot of 'minor' legacy hacks to make the code base maintainable again to be able move faster again :sweat_smile: 
 =||= Ok, this is understandable.
 =||= @simonharrer You found another one?!
 =||= https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/master/src/main/java/net/sf/jabref/groups/migrations/VersionHandling.java

It handles group versions 0, 1, 2 and 3. 3 is the current version of how groups are stored. One could still use an old group layout in their files.

This affects the bibtex file, as groups are stored in the bibtex file. I am not sure if they are updated automatically or if they are still used in the old format. 

The other change only affects preferences which are automatically updated.
 =||= Jörg moved all this stuff into `PreferencesMigrations.java`, which is a good place to tidy things up.
We can discuss a removal later on. 
Closing for now.

98Refactor BibTeX file fieldOliver Koppkoppor01/25/16, 05:20:31 PM"JabRef should be convenient for new users to use. When using the `file` field, the format for each file entry is `description:link:type`. Multiple values can be put in separated by `;`. At each file, fields can be omitted. `file = {desc}` is a valid enry. Naively, I would have assumed that `desc` is the link. Furthermore `type` is a custom JabRef string, but [Media Types](http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml) are the accepted standard for providing types.

Therefore, I propose the new format `link:description:media type`.

Furthermore, I propose dropping support for the legacy fields pdf and ps. These fields were [legacy from the end of 2007 on](https://sourceforge.net/p/jabref/mailman/message/1369285/). Even though some users want to keep the old fields, I would vote for an intuitive handling of references to external files instead of clutter the UI with legacy things. (I currently can't find the email in the mailinglist where we discussed that :()

## Discussion points

- Is media type too over-engineered? Can we drop the type completely and derive the type by the  file extension?
- Are `:` and `;` good separators?
- Is `file` really more intuitive than separate `pdf` and `ps` links? Should we keep the `pdf` field?
- Should the new field be called `attachments` to enable easy migration from the old format to the new one?

## Next steps

I would propose a discussion at this issue and I'll update this text accordingly.

We should also remove ""Tools -> Legacy Tools..."".

- Old style: http://jabref.sourceforge.net/help/ExternalFiles.php
- Current style: http://jabref.sourceforge.net/help/FileLinks.php""About ""Should we keep the pdf field?"", I would say no IF it becomes possible to define several custom general fields to manage files (BTW: this is a registered feature request). Hence, users who want to have a PDF field and a PS field and a DVI field, etc. can get it.
 =||= Related feature request: https://sourceforge.net/p/jabref/feature-requests/597/
(I didn't find the other @mlep mentioned, maybe someone else can?)
 =||= Sorry for not taking the time to point to the specific feature requests. See:

 =||= Also related: [DOS path in link](https://sourceforge.net/p/jabref/discussion/318825/thread/fa24606f/)
 =||= Before refactoring 'file' field, remember that there are at least one other
BibTeX editor out there that depends on the JabRef format, namely
Eratosthenes for Android. I also think BibDesk can convert JabRef file
links to its own format.
 =||= If the content of the file field does not contain `:` (== if someone justs pastes the file path into the field), we should interpret it as the path and not as the description. This solves the remaining problem in this issue in a straight-forward fashion.
