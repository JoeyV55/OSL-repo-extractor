Previously, it would iterate through the zones in the order\nthey were added and find the first one that fit the description. While\nthis works in most cases, if a user wants to have overlapping zones, it\nis better to iterate through all of them and find the zone that the user\nexpects. There are cases where a zone is completely inaccessible on drag\nbecause of the current code. To resolve this, the zone search will look\nfor the smallest zone possible. The reason I chose this solution is\nbecause this guarantees that zones are at least reachable since if a\nzone was bigger than another zone, then there must be a part of it\nthat is exposed, therefore reachable itself. Note: this solution is for\nthe scenario between two zones. More than that is not guaranteed. But I\nfeel like this covers enough scenarios to warrant its addition.\n\nExample:\n  ----------------\n  - Zone1        -\n  -  ----------  -\n  -  - Zone2  -  -\n  -  -        -  -\n  -  ----------  -\n  ----------------\n\nPreviously, zone2 was inaccessible since it would iterate through 1 then\n2. But 1 would always be seen first when dragging a window. With this\nfix it zone2 will be accessible.\n\n<!-- Enter a brief description/summary of your PR here.

We've had a `FancyZones::m_zoneWindowMap` field holding a reference to itself(`this`), preventing the destructor from running.\n\n<!-- Provide a more detailed description of the PR, other things fixed or any additional comments/features here -->\n## Detailed Description of the Pull Request / Additional comments\nWe never destroyed FancyZones object. The leak was happening because `FancyZones` had a field with a pointer to itself:\n- [`zoneWindow` stores ref-counter pointer to a `host`, which is the actually `FancyZones` object](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/blob/39cbc59c1282fc0b37a049a26e16f76b38058518/src/modules/fancyzones/lib/ZoneWindow.cpp#L115)\n- [We store `zoneWindow` as part of a `FancyZones::m_zoneWindowMap`](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/blob/39cbc59c1282fc0b37a049a26e16f76b38058518/src/modules/fancyzones/lib/FancyZones.cpp#L510-L513). `winrt::com_ptr::copy_from` is basically the same as `shared_ptr` copy ctor\n\nSo we need to clear the `m_zoneWindowMap` to break circularity.\n\nI've also removed some of the `com_ptr`s fields, because now that we actually call `~FancyZones`, it will free its `FancyZones::m_settings` member. But since `FancyZones` is being destroyed, that means we're in `FancyZonesModule::destroy` which has its own `FancyZonesModule::m_settings`. However, since `FancyZones::FancyZones` didn't share a refcount to the settings and instead did a `m_settings.attach(settings);`, we would crash in `~FancyZonesModule` with a double free. \n\nSame problem with a `winrt::com_ptr<IFancyZonesCallback> m_callback` basically.\n\nInitial review was done by @bzoz, and he noticed that we would later may need to call `set_config` again after `enable()` in the runner.\n\n<!-- Describe how you validated the behavior.

Since [registry operations are atomic in Windows](https://stackoverflow.com/a/706348/7995937) there is no issue of thread-safety.\n* The settings implemented so far are only the Enabled/Disabled flag for the powertoy as a whole.

This will automatically register the ShellExtensions.dll at HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\\\*\\shellex\\ContextMenuHandlers\\Image Resizer. The Resize pictures option will now appear on the context menu when an image is right clicked, however it will fail as the exe file hasn't been linked yet.\n    - Add registry entry for the ImageResizer.exe file at HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\WOW6432Node\\BriceLambson\\ImageResizer with the string value as the path of the ImageResizer.exe generated from the build (src\\modules\\imageresizer\\ImageResizer\\bin\\Debug\\ImageResizer.exe).

Thus there are entries for bmp, dib, gif, jfif, jpe, jpeg, jpg, jxr, png, rle, tif, tiff, wdp (all the directly supported types mentioned in the ImageResizer code). Images like .ico also \"work\" with the ImageResizer.exe but it converts it to jpg instead, so it doesn't actually resize a .ico back to .ico.\n- ShellImagePreview adds 4 entries: a separator, Rot right, Rot left and another separator. For a basic check without making the context menu handling more resource intensive, a simple check for a separator at the start index(indexMenu arg) has been added to make sure that if an older version of Windows is being used where ShellImagePreview isn't available or if it has been disabled the code will still run fine.\n- The drag and drop handler index was simply increased by one because **Copy here** was the initial first value in the context menu.\n<!-- Describe how you validated the behavior.

We might want to fully port it to UWP in the future, but as it currently is, the toast notifications' registration is done in a bit roundabout way.\n\nWe must implement [IBackgroundTask](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/Windows.ApplicationModel.Background.IBackgroundTask) as an in-proc activation server (WinRT analogue of in-proc COM server) if we want reacting to `ToastNotification`'s actions while the PT isn't running.\n\nSince `IBackgroundTask` implementation class should be in a WinRT component library to be built correctly, it must use the dynamic version of C/C++ runtime. That means it cannot link e.g. `common` libraries to it, since all PT's modules use static runtime instead. Moreover, it cannot be the activatable DLL directly, since in that case it must be linked to a true UWP app, otherwise we get an obscure error in the Event viewer while Windows was trying to launch our background task:\n\n> failed to activate with error code 0x8007007E\n\nAfter some researching, I've discovered that it actually means that Windows uses WinRT analogue of `regsvr32` to load notifications.dll and instantiate `IBackgroundTask`'s class, but fails to do so because of missing `msvcp140_app.dll` and the like. Those libraries are UWP versions of C/C++ runtime and, as we imagine, shouldn't be distributed with our app directly. Since we're a Desktop Bridge app, dynamic loader isn't made aware of them, and we fail to load our DLL.\n\nThat brings us to the following design:\n- `notifications` is a static WinRT library with a dynamic C/C++ runtime which implements a single `IBackgroundTask` implementation class which serves as a dispatcher for all background tasks handlers\n- all actual handlers should be implemented in `notifications` library and registered via `handler_functions.cpp:handlers_map`\n- `notifications_dll` is a classic DLL library with a dynamic C/C++ runtime which implements some plumbing and avoids having to deal with `0x8007007E`. we register it as a activator in manifest\n- `common` library and any other PT modules can use new notifications API functions for showing toasts using the `src/common/notifications.h` header\n\n## Validation Steps Performed\n- unit test passed\n- launched multiple toasts ", "NaN"], ["1181", "Runner: fix startup task state setting for MSIX", "Andrey Nekrasov", "yuyoyuppe", "01/31/20, 05:35:22 PM", "<!-- Enter a brief description/summary of your PR here.

This can be used to implement the approved apps list.\n\nFor the ShortcutGuide, the logic is relaxed to include more windows. One example are Explorer properties windows. Those are (and should) filtered by the FancyZones, but should appear in the window preview in the SCG.\n\nThe new return type also includes information if the window will react to the default Windows Snap. This is not ideal though. Currently, SCG can only disable the entire \"Windows Controls\" group.

To aid testing, I've developed a small test application which works in tandem with PowerRenameExt:\n- it locks a named mutex when launched\n- PowerRenameExt waits for this mutex to be unlocked until I've pressed a button in small application window: it stops the message pump loop (now we've \"stopped responding\") and unlocks the mutex. Pressing the button also brings the test app to the foreground.\n- PowerRenameExt attaches itself to the foreground thread from a different thread, which is killed after 10 seconds in case of hanging.\n\nActually, I've observed that even though I didn't process intentionally any messages in the test app, PowerRename didn't hang.

The shortcut can be removed by clicking the delete button.\n- Press Type shortcut to detect your shortcut. As of now the key name will not be displayed, only the code.\n- In the current version, only 2 key shortcuts will be applied. A check has not been added for the order of the keys in the UI, so while testing it make sure the modifier key is clicked first. Example: Ctrl+A and not A+Ctrl.\n- Clicking Apply will save the settings and your shortcuts will be remapped. If any of remaps were invalid, the valid ones will still apply, however a warning will be displayed on the top right corner.\n- Clicking Cancel will simply exit the window. If Apply was not clicked prior to clicking cancel then those shortcuts will not be saved.\n- If you reopen the Edit Shortcuts Window your shortcuts will still be visible.

UWP API offers [a convenient key-value storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.storage.applicationdata.localsettings), but unfortunately it's not usable for unpackaged apps (throws \"The process has no package identity.\"), so we use the same mechanism as [SHMessageBoxCheck](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-au/windows/win32/api/shlwapi/nf-shlwapi-shmessageboxchecka?redirectedfrom=MSDN) - the registry.\n- Since we use the registry, we must introduce a custom URI scheme protocol which will be handled by a PowerToys.exe, because `notifications` library, being C++/WinRT project, doesn't support any legacy APIs such registry manipulation, so we can't use a background handler to update the flag state.\n\n<!-- Describe how you validated the behavior.

The only constraint as of now is that the shortcut must be atleast 2 keys.\n- Added a function in the shortcut code to check if any other keys are pressed apart from the shortcut. This was required because in the previous version of the code, if the user remaps Ctrl+C to Ctrl+V and the user pressed Ctrl+Shift+C the system would get Ctrl+Shift+V, whereas Ctrl+Shift+C is actually a different shortcut. By checking that no other keys are pressed when Ctrl+C is pressed we can ensure to remap the exact shortcut instead of all shortcuts which contain it.\n- Summary of the remap algorithm (also present in comments across the code):\n    - Check for the last key in the original shortcut. If all the modifier keys are also pressed down **and** no other keys are pressed, then clear out all the original shortcut keys and set the new shortcut keys as pressed down.\n    - There are 4 cases to be handled if the shortcut has been pressed down\n      1. The user lets go of one of the modifier keys - reset the keyboard back to the state of the keys actually being pressed down (original shortcut keys except the one which was released)\n      2. The user keeps the shortcut pressed - the shortcut is repeated (for example you could hold down Ctrl+V and it will keep pasting)\n      3. The user lets go of the last key - reset the keyboard back to the state of the keys actually being pressed down (original shortcut except the last key)\n      4. The user presses another key while holding the shortcut down - the system now sees all the new shortcut keys and this extra key pressed at the end. Not handled as resetting the state would trigger the original shortcut once more\n- **Note:** In all the steps above, an extra check has been added to avoid resetting the state and resending key events for keys which are common between the two shortcuts. The code would still work fine without this, but to minimize latency the lesser the number of SendInput events the better.\n\n<!-- Describe how you validated the behavior. Add automated tests wherever possible, but list manual validation steps taken as well -->\n## Validation Steps Performed\n- Build and run the project.

Earlier a vector of keys was used, however this had many issues w.r.t constraining the order of keys in the UI, constraining the type of keys used in the shortcut and supporting left/right versions of modifiers.\nThis PR adds a Shortcut class instead which contains function wrappers for all shortcut key related logic, while maintaining most of the actual remap logic in dllmain.cpp\n\n<!-- Please review the items on the PR checklist before submitting-->\n## PR Checklist\n* [X] Applies to #6\n* [X] CLA signed.

It also contains member functions for converting to virtual key codes, converting to string, and other remapping logic functions.\n- Added a RemapShortcut class. Earlier the std::map used was std:map<vector, pair<vector, bool>>. To clean this up, it is now std:map<Shortcut, RemapShortcut> where RemapShortcut consists of a Shortcut (the target shortcut), a bool variable (for checking if the shortcut was invoked), and a ModifierKey value to check which Windows key was pressed. The last is required to handle shortcut remaps which can work for either win key (there is no virtual key code for a common win key like that which exists for Ctrl, Alt, Shift). This value is used to remember which Win key was pressed when the shortcut was invoked. It is kept in this RemapShortcut class and not in the shortcut class itself since the key object in an std::map must be const and cannot be modified.\n- The Shortcut class now allows all modifiers to have displayable name based on whether it was left or right (example LCtrl or RCtrl) and a common one as well (Ctrl).\n- Common versions of all modifiers have been implemented. A user can now use Ctrl+A rather than LCtrl+A specifically. This is however not yet accessible on the UI since the detect key window won't show that according to the spec. By making the common ctrl key work on the backend this allows the drop down UI work for shortcuts.\n- A DecodeKey function has been added in Shortcut class which converts the key code to the key name. This currently only shows a name for modifier keys since those are fixed. This function would have to be moved out later since it isn't specific for shortcuts. This will be done when the keyboard unicode mapping code is integrated.\n- RCtrl and RAlt have not yet been handled correctly (to be done in another PR).\n- The changes should improve performance a bit for remapping since fixed size objects are now used instead of dynamic vectors.\n\n<!-- Describe how you validated the behavior.

This will be moved to an rc file in a later PR.\n- For virtual key code 255 (which is sent as an \"unknown\" key from some keyboards on clicking Fn key) it has been named as `Undefined`.\n- The display name has been added only for the edit keyboard section because there was a lot of refactoring for shortcuts in #1927 .\n- Earlier in order to store the key codes internally before clicking apply in the edit keyboard window, we were just converting from the string displayed key code to DWORD. However this can't be done after adding the key names, and it may not be reliable to convert key names to key codes because there could be a language change. Hence a buffer vector was added which stores the current keys in the edit keyboard window and gets updated with every update on the UI. On clicking apply the buffer is copied to the actual key remappings.\n\n<!-- Describe how you validated the behavior.

This move any code that doesn't require direct access to the UI thread out.

We can choose to not show the unknown keys in the future. In case of Edit shortcuts there is an additional \"None\" key at the start which is used to remove the drop down.\n- Since in the current key names some key representations could be repeated (for example there are two `/` keys on the keyboard), key selections are made with a second vector which has the corresponding virtual key code for each key name, rather than searching from the keyboard map. This way we ensure a one-to-one mapping since we search index to key code and not key name to key code.\n- KeyType helper functions added to categorize keys depending on the type of modifier or if it is an action key.\n- Flyout warnings have been added to manage all the scenarios in the drop down input for Edit Shortcuts. These include warnings for making sure that there is atleast 2 keys, there must be exactly one action key, there needs to be a modifier key, action key must be at the end, and a modifier cannot be repeated (example LCtrl and RCtrl).\n- Changed the logic for creating the custom controls to dynamic allocation using unique_ptr since there were cases where the objects were going out of scope and variables were being referenced to result in garbage values.\n\n<!-- Describe how you validated the behavior.

For these keys an extended key flag is included during SendInput in order to work properly. If that wasn't added you would get weird behaviour if you remapped LShift to RCtrl, held down LShift and switch to another window and then release LShift, it would act as if RCtrl was still held down.\n- Another issue that was fixed was for shortcuts containing Ins, Home, Pg keys, Del, End and Arrow keys. It was observed that the shortcuts would not get remapped if Num lock was turned on. It turns out that this was because for shortcut remappings we ensure that no other key states are set to \"down\" but when num lock is pressed, an undocumented `0xFF` is set to down. Now we don't check the 0xFF key code.\n\n## References\n- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/virtual-key-codes\n- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/about-keyboard-input#extended-key-flag\n\n<!-- Please review the items on the PR checklist before submitting-->\n## PR Checklist\n* [X] Applies to #6\n* [X] CLA signed.

Current Design is to save the configuration independent from the `settings.json` in a separate file `config-name.json`. This will be make the support of multiple configuration easier and configurations file can be shared or use templates.\n2. Added a fake Key Code to represent equivalent to `VK_WIN`.\n3. Current Design is updating a dummy `settings-updated.json` to communicate to Settings process that the config json have been successfully updated so settings process can read the file. The reason for using because `FileSystemWatcher` raises trigger events multiple time during a file update and the settings process have no knowledge if the runner process is still writing to the file. Alternatively, a polling approach can be used here as well to retry after sometime to see if file is free.\n4. `FileSystemWatcher` fires multiple events on writing to a file. Added a logic to treat all the events fired with a Time threshold as one.\n\n<!-- Describe how you validated the behavior.

What does it fix/what does it change/how was it tested (even manually, if necessary)? -->\n## Summary of the Pull Request\nRemapping the common version of `Ctrl/Alt/Shift` behaves differently from other keys since clicking those keys those not actually result in a `VK_CONTROL`, `VK_MENU` and `VK_SHIFT`. Those key codes can be used in `SendInput` or `GetAsyncKeyState` but they are not naturally generated on key press (only the L or R version is generated). To solve this without modifying the remap logic, we tweak the remappings while saving and loading on the UI. \n**Example:**\nIf user chooses to remap `Alt -> A` on the UI, we store `LAlt -> A` and `RAlt -> B` in the map.\nWhile loading the existing maps into the UI, we check if `LAlt` and `RAlt` are both remapped, and if they are remapped to the same key then we combine them to Alt while showing them in the UI. This also makes it more consistent. However on the UI someone may still remap both `LAlt` and `Alt`, this has not been blocked. In this case whichever is first gets priority. If `LAlt`, is first then the `LAlt` remapping is applied and the `RAlt` is remapped to whatever Alt was remapped to. If `Alt` is first then both are remapped to the same value.\n\n<!-- Please review the items on the PR checklist before submitting-->\n## PR Checklist\n* [X] Applies to #6\n* [X] CLA signed.

This had to be changed to a static lib (following the approach taken by PowerRename and other powertoys), since only the main extension dll gets loaded from the runner, and this fails if the KBMUI dll file is not in the same folder as the runner exe file. Another workaround would be to add a LoadLibrary call in the runner, but that would involve too many changes to common PowerToys code. The output dir was also changed to `modules/`\n- After changing the folders and compiling there were some runtime errors occuring with the `to_hstring` function when directly with constant strings (example: `to_hstring(L\"Type key\")`). While checking this I observed `to_hstring` was actually not needed, as `wchar` strings can get automatically type casted by functions requiring `hstring` as argument. All those unnecessary `to_hstring` calls were removed.\n- Removed some helper functions which were now unused\n", "NaN"], ["2235", "Launcher Light/Dark mode", "Divyansh", "somil55", "04/20/20, 08:34:37 AM", "<!-- Enter a brief description/summary of your PR here.

Since these indices are reliable and match what is shown on the UI, the index will always match the buffer vector where the values are stored.\n- Moved drop down selection handlers out of the constructor to a separate function. This was done since all the associated controls may not be initialized at the constructor stage (some stack panels in the parent class would be null).\n- Changed the C++ window logic to account for resizing. Earlier only on the WM_PAINT message the Xaml UI would be resized. However that message is not sent if the window is resized smaller. That has now been fixed.\n\n## Screenshots\n![keyboardManagerDynamic](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32061677/79919609-93e08080-83e3-11ea-8da8-e73219a57841.gif)\n", "NaN"], ["2308", "Add support for Common Win key in KBM", "Arjun Balgovind", "arjunbalgovind", "04/23/20, 03:37:53 PM", "<!-- Enter a brief description/summary of your PR here.

For remaps from something to Win key, we handle it by considering the target key to be LWin since the VK_WIN_BOTH is a fake key code (unlike that used for Alt, Ctrl and Shift).\n- For shortcuts where remap is from Win + something, we have an additional flag in the RemapShortcut class (added in an earlier PR) which is used to remember which win key was pressed (L or R). This information is required since we need to reset the state of the key which the user presses and we cannot default to LWin, since that would result in reseting LWin while the user is pressing down RWin. For remaps to Win + something, we simply use LWin.

What does it fix/what does it change/how was it tested (even manually, if necessary)? -->\n## Summary of the Pull Request\nThis PR removes all the earlier warning messages from flyouts and now uses an Error icon with a tooltip of the error message. The reason for this is because Flyouts interrupt user input, so by moving the warning to a hidden tooltip, its less intrusive for the user. The PR also adds handling for remapping a key/shortcut to itself, remapping a key/shortcut twice, conflicting remaps (like Ctrl (Left) and Ctrl) and Win L and Ctrl Alt Del remaps. The only flyouts that have been maintained for now are on the Apply button. The key order was also modified to improve search.\n\n<!-- Please review the items on the PR checklist before submitting-->\n## PR Checklist\n* [X] Applies to #2216 \n* [X] CLA signed. If not, go over [here](https://cla.opensource.microsoft.com/microsoft/PowerToys) and sign the CLA\n\n## Things that can be improved\n- While moving to the tooltip based warning makes it less blocking for the user, we should still make it more visible for the user. Maybe like a red colored icon, or if possible the tooltip should force show up without hover so that the user notices it.\n- Another option is to show a warning next to which ever key/shortcut is giving an error, rather than a single one for the whole row. That way the mouseover point will be close to where the error occured.\n- Currently if there is an error in both shortcuts in a row, we update the tooltip with the latest error. The warning should be improved to list out all the issues in the shortcuts rather than the latest applied one.\n\n<!-- Provide a more detailed description of the PR, other things fixed or any additional comments/features here -->\n## Detailed Description of the Pull Request / Additional comments\n- Reordered the keys in drop down as the following groups:\n    - Numbers/Alphabets/Symbols\n    - Modifiers\n    - Other named keys\n    - Unknown keys\nEach of the above groups are sorted in alphabetical order to improve search as suggested by @traies and @saahmedm \n- Removed flyouts and changed to a warning symbol with tooltip. This makes it easier for the user to search without being blocked by the flyout popping up.\n- A warning was also added for incomplete remapping (where a shortcut is incomplete or a row in the remap is incomplete), but this warning is only showed when pressing apply, so that the user does not see an incomplete warning while adding a new row. Also this helps is pointing out which remaps were unsuccessful when the remap partially fails\n- Constraint on number of keys for shortcut that can be added from UI changed from 5 to 3.\n<!-- Describe how you validated the behavior. Add automated tests wherever possible, but list manual validation steps taken as well -->\n## Validation Steps Performed\nRun and add different types of shortcuts, both using drop downs and by type shortcut.

It became apparent when using the arrow keys to update the query text programatically, that there were holes in the logic to prevent updating the query when we change the text.

Some code was changed in terms of how the `DesktopWindowXamlSource` object was declared, as it was found that the `RelativePanel xamlContainer` object had to be declared only after the xaml source object was created to avoid errors.\n- The other main change from the reference was the ClearXamlIslands function was called after the message loop rather than on receiving the WM_DESTROY message because it was causing crashes.\n- The reference code was also structured in a way that involved classes and inheritance with all the xaml controls in wrappers. To minimize the amount of refactoring the classes were restructured to a single class with helper functions for focus navigation rather than using that as the class for creating all the C++ windows and xaml island controls.\n\n<!-- Describe how you validated the behavior.

The script runs a build of the project and its dependencies and publish with the required configuration as required for the current MSI. Comments have been added to the script with REM commands.

I am not sure why normally building with VS doesn't throw a warning or error about the same.\n- There was a missing file in the UWP project which existed but was not referenced in the project.\n- The script in short runs a MSBuild publish task (which internally does build followed by publish). Some extra code had to be added to ensure it doesnt run into a recurse loop, since the msbuild task is a post build event.\n- For publishing, a publish profile file needs to be created, that has been hardcoded into the script.\n- For changing the MSI from its current behaviour to self-contained we would have to change one parameter in the script, as well as add the extra dll files created into the Wix toolset file.\n- Since the script code is only readable when opening it in VS here is the code\n\n      rem Check required to avoid a recursive loop of building\n\n      IF NOT DEFINED settingsBuildEventCompleted (\n      setlocal enableDelayedExpansion\n      SET settingsProfileFolderName=Properties\\PublishProfiles\\\n\n      rem Create the publish profile folder if it doesn't exist\n      IF NOT EXIST !settingsProfileFolderName!

What does it fix/what does it change/how was it tested (even manually, if necessary)? -->\n## Summary of the Pull Request\nThe crash mentioned in the linked issue was happening because we use a single KeyboardManagerState variable for both of the windows, so when one of the windows is closed there is most likely something getting set to `nullptr` while a window is still open. The way the code was written was considering only one window open, so the best way to solve this with minimal changes is to ensure only one window can be opened at a time.\nThe PR changes the behavior of the buttons, such that when clicking either of the buttons - if Edit keyboard or edit shortcut either of them are open, it will bring that window in focus. Earlier if Edit keyboard was open and you clicked the same button again, it would just bring that to focus. By this change we ensure that only one window is open at a time, and by bring that in focus the user should also notice the window lying open.\nThis is a first step for #2466 . The pending work for the modal dialog is to prevent the user from being able to access the Settings window while this dialog box is up.\n\nThis also adds a fix where the remap button would stop working if you closed KBM from the taskbar (the runner would not crash though).\n\n<!-- Please review the items on the PR checklist before submitting-->\n## PR Checklist\n* [X] Applies to #2469, #2569 \n* [X] CLA signed.

The issue that F5 does a build even when there is no change in files still exists however.\nThe PR currently removed the publish post build events and instead adds publishing as pre-build events in the installer project\n\n## Details of the PR\n- Removed post-build events in Settings and Launcher\n- Disabled IncrementalClean targets for Settings and Launcher\n- Updated Wox project output directories to separate directories to avoid clash with PowerLauncher.csproj output\n- Added the telemetry dlls for Launcher and Settings introduced in #2696 to the MSI.\n- Removed the Wox json files and the PowerLauncher.runtimeconfig.dev.json from the MSI since those are not used. The runtimeconfig.dev.json contains file paths for the local nuget packages on the machine so those should not be included in MSI, they are only there for functioning on the dev machine.\n- Added the following command line pre-build events to PowerToysSetup project\n  - Creates pubxml publishing profile based on the required parameters (using a publish profile is the only way and recommended way for publishing .NET Core projects).\n  - Publishes the .NET Core project based on those parameters\n  - The same is repeated for Settings and Launcher.\n  - rem statements have been added as comments\n\n        setlocal enableDelayedExpansion\n\n        rem Publish Settings\n        SET settingsProfileFolderName=..\\..\\..\\..\\src\\core\\Microsoft.PowerToys.Settings.UI.Runner\\Properties\\PublishProfiles\\\n        rem Create the publish profile folder if it doesn%27t exist\n        IF NOT EXIST !settingsProfileFolderName!

A separate issue can be created for this and it may be possible to fix this by tweaking the target conditions (enabling incremental clean only for the Clean target).\n- #2758 still exists on the build farm.

The main issue with the flyout system was that drop downs were almost unusable since searching on them would trigger flyouts even if you dont select them.\n\n<!-- Please review the items on the PR checklist before submitting-->\n## PR Checklist\n* [X] Applies to #2778 , #2665\n* [X] CLA signed.

The [ComboBox.SelectionChanged](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.controls.primitives.selector.selectionchanged?view=winrt-18362) handler gets called even when searching in the drop down and a selection is highlighted. This would cause the flyout to appear and it would close the drop down. This caused issues such that if the user cannot type A because it's the first drop down, they could not search for Alt either since A would be the first selection and the flyout would pop up.\n- Based on an idea from [this stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16966264/what-event-handler-to-use-for-combobox-item-selected-selected-item-not-necessar), I moved the selection handler to the \"Drop Down closed\" event. By doing this the selection logic and validation of the shortcut is done only when the drop down is closed, so searching is not affected by this. This however would not work for the following two scenarios:\n1. The user uses Type Key/shortcut to enter a key/shortcut and presses OK. In this case the drop downs get populated but it is never opened/closed so that method would not get triggered\n2. When opening remap key/shortcuts if you have old remappings then those would have to be reloaded. Again in this case dropdownClosed is not triggered.\n3. If the user has keyboard focus on the combo box and just types in something, dropDownClosed isnt triggered.\n- To handle the above to cases we have to use the SelectionChangedHandler, however we have to ensure we only do this only for those cases. This is done by checking if the drop down is currently closed. This encompasses all the above cases and the only case where it still happens apart from the above list is if we SetSelectedIndex from within the DropDownClosed handler. Since we only set it to -1 there, and we chave checked for SelectedIndex !=-1 in the selectionchanged logic this is not a problem. All other cases where you have to open the drop down and you click something do not trigger SelectionChanged because SelectionChanged is called first, then the dropDownClosed handler is called, so the drop down is considered open during that.\n- After switching to the flyout case there was one bug with using None. If you would set None and the drop down gets deleted but the resulting shortcut has a conflict with another shortcut then an error would occur because a flyout would try to open on that deleted drop down. This has been resolved by doing the drop down deletion only after ensuring that there are no other errors/conflicts if that drop down was removed.\n\n<!-- Describe how you validated the behavior.

This has been fixed with the following changes:\n- Shortened some unnecessarily long key names\n- Added a second stack panel row, such that when more than 3 keys are entered they are added to the second row - the stack panel is hidden if there are 3 keys or lesser that have been pressed so that the double margin does not appear.\n\nThe changes only affect UI and makes no change to the actual logic in shared info between the threads.\n\n**Note:** Couldn't use text wrapping to do the second row method, because a stack panel cannot be wrapped since it extends based on the content. The other alternative would be to add a max width to each textblock and wrap each of them but that would appear worse.\n\n<!-- Please review the items on the PR checklist before submitting-->\n## PR Checklist\n* [X] Applies to #2465 (Closes #2465)\n* [X] CLA signed.

Because of this, we stop swallowing input only when Enter key is released, and this allows us to avoid the issue where pressing Enter triggers the Type key button again.\n- onPress is performed in case of the long press delay handler (along with the primary button color change even though that would appear for just a few milliseconds but the user can notice it)\n- onRelease is performed in case of the key release delay handler so that when user lets go of Enter key everything in the KBM state is cleared up\n- We define onAccept as onPress followed by onRelease so that primary button click behavior remains unchanged\n\n<!-- Describe how you validated the behavior.

It's implemented as a C++ CA instead of using `util:CloseApplication`, because I was keep getting this error:\n\n```\nMSI (s) (EC!AC) [11:49:03:171]: Product: PowerToys (Preview) -- The installer has encountered an unexpected error installing this package.

In short, scheduling `WixCloseApplications` before `InstallInitialize` was breaking the installer, but scheduling it after it wasn't sufficient, since the dialog from #2887 is generated during `InstallValidate`, which runs before `InstallInitialize`.\n\nWe also need certain logic of terminating the process: first we send WM_CLOSE, then we wait for a `timeout` value and terminate the process. This ensures that .NET core dlls are unloaded and we don't encounter #2887.

Where provided in xaml specify IsRightTapEnabled=False\n2. Override the listviewitem control template so that IsRightTapEnabled can be set to false on the ListViewItemPresenter \n3. On items with no control template such as tool tip and font icon, recurse the visual tree, and set IsRightTapEnabled to false. \n4. WHen the context button items are changing then recurse the visual tree and set IsRightTapEnabled.  Note this is less efficient than overwritting the template but this is only done on selected or hovered items and there are a small number of elements in the visual tree.   Alternatively we could overwrite the GridView and GridView item control templates, but this is quite verbose and error prone, for small perf impact. \n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56318517/82479936-e74bfa00-9a87-11ea-84c1-4c4a4ed1ab3b.png)\n\n\n<!-- Describe how you validated the behavior.

However, this does not work when there is a namespace with Resources already defined like in the case of the Camera app.\nDue to this the DisplayName and Description were not being retrived and hence the app was not displayed.

What does it fix/what does it change/how was it tested (even manually, if necessary)? -->\n## Summary of the Pull Request\nThis PR adds handling for shortcuts which behave like Alt+Tab and Win+Space. These shortcuts behave differently from others since once you invoke Alt+Tab and release Tab, the window switcher remains open as long as Alt is pressed, so if a user remaps Ctrl+C to Alt+Tab we need to make sure as long as Ctrl is held and a user does not press a key apart from C, then Alt should remain as being held to the OS.\n\n<!-- Please review the items on the PR checklist before submitting-->\n## PR Checklist\n* [X] Applies to #3294, #3331, #3546, #3727 \n* [X] CLA signed.

If it is, we directly skip control to that shortcut remap. This is required for the new change, since we leave the shortcut in invoked state even if all the keys are not held down.\n- Changed the case where modifiers of original shortcut are held down and action key is released - Now we only send key up for the new shortcut's action key (and we do not change the modifiers).\n- If a modifier key is pressed down which is already pressed down in the original shortcut, then suppress that key message. (can happen if user presses LCtrl and RCtrl for a Ctrl based shortcut, or if a user has 2 copies of the same modifier key (by remapping)).\n- If any key other than original shortcut keys is pressed, revert the state to the original shortcut followed by the new key pressed. The original shortcut's action key needs to be sent only if it was actually held down, which can be checked by checking async key state of the new shortcut's action key.\n- Added safety code to reset the shortcut invoked flag if none of the cases match. This code shouldn't execute in any real world situation but if it's added to avoid any unexpected behavior to make sure KBM doesn't get stuck on any one shortcut.\n\n## Known Issues\n- If a user remaps Ctrl+Alt+A to Alt+Tab (i.e. a shortcut containing old and some other modifier to Alt+Tab), then the window switcher stays up until alt is released (and not Ctrl). This is because in our logic when switching back to the original shortcut we do not resend Alt Up, Alt Down because that causes weird behavior with Alt triggering menu bars. Similar issue exists for Win+Shift+S to Win+Space. A workaround would be to hardcode the behavior for these 2 shortcuts (Alt Tab and Win Space), however there might be more shortcuts which follow this style of shortcut remains held till modifier is released.\n\n<!-- Describe how you validated the behavior.

However, this was true only in case of exe's and not lnk's. Hence, added an additional check to remove only the exe applications which do not have an lnkResolvedPath. This solves the issue of applications like `File Explorer` not showing up because they are lnk files without a resolvedPath.\n* The check that we previously had wherein we removed apps with the same `LnkResolvedPath` was not sufficient because shortcuts in different locations have different lnkResolved paths  (as mentioned in this comment - https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/issues/3180#issuecomment-631083296). Therefore, using the condition that if two applications have the same name, same executable name and same FullPath, they are qualified as the same item.\n\n<!-- Describe how you validated the behavior.

This can be moved to common lib in a future PR in case it could be useful to other PowerToys.\n\n<!-- Please review the items on the PR checklist before submitting-->\n## PR Checklist\n* [X] Applies to #3112 \n* [X] CLA signed.

For C++ mocking, based on [this article](https://games.greggman.com/game/using-a-mock-library-to-make-unit-testing-easier-in-c/), some of the code was refactored such that SendInput and GetAsyncKeyState functions were wrapped into a class derived from an interface. On the test project side this interface was implemented with mocked functions.\n- The mocked input was simulated by storing a keyboard state variables (stores true or false for all 256 virtual key codes), and SendInput was mocked such that it iterates over the key events, and calls the hook on each of them, and it doesn't  set the keyboard state variable if the hook suppresses the event. This logic was done to simulate how SendInput and low level hooks actually work.\n- In order to keep the MockedInput, Input and InputInterface classes as reusable as possible, under MockedInput rather than hardcoding in the low level hook procedure, it was set such that there is a reference to an std::function which can be set at runtime. Thus it is possible to test code without any hook as well.\n- For making tests independent, at the start of each test the KeyboardState variable is reset, hook is set to null and all remappings are cleared.\n\n## Tests Added\n- **Mocked Input Sanity Test** - To ensure that the mocked input infrastructure is working, we check the keyboard state before and after a key event.\n- **Single Key Remapping:**\n    - Basic test to check if target key is set for a remapped key\n    - If a key is remapped to disabled, then it shouldn't change the keyboard state (this exists in the backend but hasn't been exposed to the UI as a feature yet)\n    - If a key is remapped to Win (Both) it should set the Win (left) key state (since Win Both is not an actual key code, its created by us)\n- **OS Level Shortcut Remapping:**\n    - The following cases were tested for all the scenarios - i.e. on shortcut key down, on pressing and releasing the shortcut, and separate cases were made for shortcuts with the same modifiers, different modifiers, or some common modifiers\n        - Two key shortcut to two key shortcut\n        - Two key shortcut to three key shortcut\n        - Three key shortcut to two key shortcut\n        - Three key shortcut to three key shortcut\n    - If a two key shortcut is remapped, invoking a three key shortcut containing that should not get remapped. Ex: Ctrl+A->Alt+D, Ctrl+Shift+A should not be affected\n    - If a three key shortcut is remapped, invoking a two key shortcut which is a subset of that should not get remapped. Ex: Ctrl+Shift+A->Alt+D, Ctrl+A should not be affected\n    - If a shortcut is remapped, and after invoking it you press another action key without releasing the modifiers, it should reset back to the physical keys being pressed (if they are not remapped). Ex: Ctrl+A remapped to Alt+D. User presses Ctrl+A, releases A and then presses C, keyboard should detect it as Ctrl+C and do Copy action.\n    - If a shortcut with Win (Both) is remapped, it should work with both Win (Left) or Win (Right). (Test added since Win (Both) isn't an actual key code)\n    - If a shortcut with Win (Both) is remapped, and after invoking it with Win (Left/Right) you press another action key without releasing the modifiers, it should reset back to the physical keys being pressed, i.e. the same win key which was pressed (L/R).\n    - Test for Alt+Tab fix behavior (#3965) - If a shortcut is remapped, and you invoke it but only let go of the action key, the modifier should remain pressed until a key not present in the shortcut is pressed. Required to test that remaps to Alt+Tab behave correctly.\n## Pending Work\n- Integration tests for interaction between single key remaps and shortcut remaps. To be tracked in a separate issue.\n\n<!-- Describe how you validated the behavior.

The error was occurring because of the scenarios where a warning is displayed and the drop down gets reset, but the resultant shortcut also has an error.\nExample:\n- Add shortcut remap Ctrl(L)+Alt(L)+A -> Ctrl(L)+A\n- Change Alt(L) to Ctrl. Warning will appear and UI becomes Ctrl(L)+Blank+A -> Ctrl(L)+A. This is actually invalid and a warning should appear again, but our logic was getting executed only once.\n- Pressing OK saves the changes even though it is invalid.

Earlier it was hardcoded into the selection handler lambda function.\n- `CheckRepeatedModifier` and `GetKeysFromStackPanel` were made static as they are independent of the current object.\n- In order to fix the issue, after validating the shortcut in the current drop down's selection handler, if an error was observed, we iterate over all the drop downs which aren't blank and run the validation logic on them as well, to ensure that another error is not present.\n\n## Known issues\n- Though it fixes the problems for these situations where multiple errors occur, appropriate warnings do not get shown because WinUI only shows the last activated flyout. Since the validation is almost immediate, only the last flyout warning is visible to the user.\n\n<!-- Describe how you validated the behavior.

The issue occurred because the Num Lock key state is set before the key down message is intercepted by low level hooks, so even if it is suppressed the Num Lock key state will still change. To work around this, whenever a NumLock key down message is to be suppressed, we additionally send NumLock Key Up, Key Down to make sure that the final state of Num Lock is unchanged.\n**Explanation:** NumLock was turned off and user remapped Num Lock to A. When user presses NumLock internally it gets set to ON. Key up is passed to release the key, and next key down sets the state to OFF. Both of these events are suppressed so that they not get sent to any other hooks or the OS. Then when the user releases the Num Lock key it gets set back to released state.\n\n<!-- Please review the items on the PR checklist before submitting-->\n## PR Checklist\n* [X] Applies to #3277 \n* [X] CLA signed.

This was easier since that is the final line of code where all the hook suppressions enter irrespective of the cause of the key suppression.\n- To ensure that the workaround Num Lock events are always suppressed, an additional flag was added, which is set in the dwExtraInfo param when using SendInput. In the hook logic, whenever an event is seen with this flag it will be suppressed without performing any remap logic.\n\n<!-- Describe how you validated the behavior.

What does it fix/what does it change/how was it tested (even manually, if necessary)? -->\n## Summary of the Pull Request\nThis PR changes the way Caps Lock remaps are done by KBM. The issue when remapping CapsLock to Ctrl in Japanese happens because Shift+CapsLock, Alt+CapsLock, Ctrl+CapsLock are all global shortcuts to change the input method (as per [this stackexchange post](https://japanese.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1867/change-keyboard-shortcuts-for-windows-ime)), and they seem to be triggered even if the Caps Lock key event is suppressed. CapsLock should get suppressed so the Ctrl+Caps Lock state should never be seen by the OS, but it looks like the IME handler reads the key states before the key is intercepted by low level hooks which is why this happens.\n\n~~The workaround is such that whenever a user has remapped Caps Lock to another key (say Ctrl), whenever they press Caps Lock and we have to suppress it, we first send a Caps Lock key up event and make sure that is suppressed (using a flag), and then we send the remapped key (Ctrl). Since the Caps Lock key up event is suppressed it doesnt affect any other applications, and I validated that remapping CapsLock works fine in English(US). For the case in question however, the workaround prevents Ctrl+CapsLock shortcut from being triggered only if PT is run as admin, since the IME handler most likely runs elevated as well. The workaround doesn't help while running as a normal user, but it does not have any adverse effects either.~~\n\n**Edit:** As per the feedback from the AHK team on the issue at https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/issues/3397#issuecomment-640136416, I've changed the workaround to the better version that involves changing the modifier key state rather than Caps Lock. The workaround is such that if Caps Lock is remapped to Ctrl/Shift/Alt then after sending Ctrl key down as the remap, we also send a Ctrl key up but we add a flag such that that event is always suppressed. Since it is suppressed this change only affects applications that read input before low level hooks (like IME). When remapping from Ctrl/Shift/Alt to Caps Lock, we send a Ctrl key up (which is suppressed) before we send the Caps Lock key down message.\n\n<!-- Please review the items on the PR checklist before submitting-->\n## PR Checklist\n* [X] Applies to #3397\n* [X] CLA signed.

In the future we could merge os-detection.dll into the PowerToysInterop library to reduce the number of additional projects/dlls.\n- In the Microsoft.Launcher project (which is the PowerToyModule project for PT Run), under the enable method where PowerLauncher.exe is launched a check has been added to launch the executable only if it matches the OS requirement.\n\n<!-- Other than the issue solved, is this relevant to any other issues/existing PRs? --> \n## References\n\n<!-- Please review the items on the PR checklist before submitting-->\n## PR Checklist\n* [X] Applies to #3730 \n* [X] CLA signed.

This solves most of the cases of focus - i.e. when any window currently has focus (with the exception of start menu). The following cases have not been solved, which were working earlier because of the code being executed from the RegisterHotkey handler.\n- Alt+Space is hit when the Start menu is open - Start menu remains open and still has keyboard focus even though PT Run appears\n- Opening and closing Start menu, and hitting Alt+Space before shifting focus to any other window (i.e. taskbar still has keyboard focus)\n\nAfter merging this in we can create a separate issue for tracking the two cases mentioned above.\n<!-- Please review the items on the PR checklist before submitting-->\n## PR Checklist\n* [X] Applies to #4270 \n* [X] CLA signed.

Users observed that while NumLock was one, the remappings would behave weirdly when held in combinations like Shift+Home would end up only doing Home. The fix involves setting the extended key flag for all the following keys:\nIns, Home, PgUp, Del, End, PgDn, Left arrow, Right arrow, Down arrow and Up arrow.\n\nThe reason for the bug was that when using SendInput for those virtual key codes without the extended key flag, it actually sends the scan code for the NumPad equivalent of these keys. This could easily be observed if you try out AHK's key detection tool, it detects all those events as NumPad keys. When NumLock is ON, those keys are not actually supposed to exist, which may have caused the unexpected behavior. The normal variants of those keys require the extended key flag for correct behavior.\n\nFor adding tests an additional lib reference to shlwapi.lib was noticed to be required which was used in the KBM common project. To fix that the lib references were moved to the respective projects where they were used.\n\n<!-- Please review the items on the PR checklist before submitting-->\n## PR Checklist\n* [X] Applies to #3478 , #3647, #3981 \n* [X] CLA signed.

The issue was happening on machines with nView Desktop Manager, where it would intercept some window messages and cause WinUI to think the xaml island window was hidden. To work around this, in the WindowXamlHost when the ChildChanged event is called, if the window is not closed we call Show().\n\nSince WPF does not have a property to check if the window is closing, we use the Closing event handler to set a bool variable to track if the window has started closing.

One of the reasons for this to happen was that all the image icons were cached. \n* Even though the code had an upperlimit on the `maxCached` values which was set to 5000, this part of the code was never called unless powerToys was closed. \n* Therefore, since all the icons were being cached, the size of the dictionary continued to increase.\n\n**Work around**-\n* Instead of caching all images and increasing the size of the dictionary, the following changes have been made -\n1. Reduce the number of cached images to 50.\n2. If the number of images increase over the permissible factor (set to 2) of the cached images (ie. 2 * 50), then the ones which are infrequently used would be removed from the dictionary and there be 50 images that are cached.\nThis ensures that the dictionary size is always less than 100.\n\n<!-- Please review the items on the PR checklist before submitting-->\n## PR Checklist\n* [x] Applies to #2047.\n* [x] CLA signed.

Add automated tests wherever possible, but list manual validation steps taken as well -->\n\n## Validation Steps Performed\n\nThe changes in this PR can be validated by following these steps -\n1. Take snapshots of the memory usage by using the Diagnostic tools of Visual studio (Debug -> Windows -> Diagnostic tools).\n2. Take the first snapshot after all the dlls are loaded and the memory utilization is stabilized.\n3. Take the next memory snapshot after many queries (don't have to execute an application). The aim is to just load many icons.\n4. Compare the second snapshot by setting the first one as the baseline.\n5. Search for memory size diff in bytes for Concurrent Dictionary with value ImageSource.\n6. Compare this value to that obtained without the changes in this PR, to get the results as shown in the following images.\n\n* Before this change (after about twenty searches)-\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28739210/85344943-e3a3fc80-b4a5-11ea-919e-6226a3132b16.png)\n\n* After this change (after about twenty searches) -\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28739210/85344930-df77df00-b4a5-11ea-98bf-cc5fc58c9c72.png)\n\n\n## Outstanding tasks\n* Even though this fixes the issue partially, the memory consumed by PT Run is still high. It starts off with 160/170 MB and after first launch goes up to 230/250 MB, following which it increases a little on each run.\n* Another area where the memory utilization can be improved is the `Dictionary<int64, WeakReference>`. The following snapshots are after searching for a few apps using PT Run -\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28739210/85345097-63ca6200-b4a6-11ea-80b3-fc80a78c9841.png)\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28739210/85345103-69c04300-b4a6-11ea-899b-99bbaaa11e07.png)\n\nIt seems like this is related to the `ResourceDictionary` of the UI components. The number of elements in this dictionary and the components that they are referring to seem to increase on each run. This needs further investigation.\n\n## Additional Information\n* I tried to set a hard limit on the heap size using `runtime.config.json` and `System.GC.HeapHardLimit`. I did not notice any drastic differences in the Garbage collection when the limit was set to values ranging from 20 MB to 200 MB. Also, this might differ from system to system so I did not go down this route.\n\nReferences - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/run-time-config/garbage-collector", "NaN"], ["4445", "Added info to FancyZones, KeyboardManager and PowerLauncher projects", "Yevhenii Holovachov", "yevhenii44", "06/23/20, 03:36:40 PM", "<!-- Enter a brief description/summary of your PR here.

Because of the process not terminating, clicking the PowerToys icon from the systray wouldn't work.

This was also resulting in new threads being created every time the FZ or PT Run page were opened, which could have perf/memory impact. With the changes in the PR, only one additional thread can be created at any point of time, and the thread is present only while the FZ or PT Run page are open.\n\n- To fix this, in the Unloaded handler of the Hotkey user control we add a step to dispose the `KeyboardHook` object. This result in the KeyboardHook object's destructor getting called, however this was hanging on the step `kbmDispatch->Join()`. This was happening because DispatchProc was stuck on the [Monitor::Wait statement](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/blob/147c08bd71ab5b260f077ce96957b0a79c33fbad/src/common/interop/KeyboardHook.cpp#L42) so even though `quit` was set to `false`, it would never reach that statement to exit the while loop. \n\n- This is fixed by calling [`Monitor::Pulse`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.monitor.pulse?view=netcore-3.1) in the destructor to notify the `DispatchProc` thread to continue and end the [`Wait`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.monitor.wait?view=netcore-3.1) statement. In order to call Pulse, the calling thread must have ownership of the Monitor, which is why `Monitor::Enter` and `Monitor::Exit` are also done in the destructor.\n\n<!-- Please review the items on the PR checklist before submitting-->\n## PR Checklist\n* [X] Applies to #4429 \n* [X] CLA signed.

To fix this, we first send WM_CLOSE signal to process and give it 2sec time to stop itself, otherwise we kill it using `TerminateProcess`. \n2. Serialization error was being thrown when writing/reading cache for Image and Pinyin.

Binary Storage - used by the cache\n2. Json Storage - Used for the settings.json files.\n\n* However, these files cause inconsistencies on upgrading, especially the Binary storage files, which are binary dumps of the objects (Win32, UWP, Imagecache etc). If there is any change in the format of the object, this leads to an inconsistent cache file which needs to be cleared.\n* To prevent the issue where the user has to manually delete the cache files, everytime the files are loaded during the start of PT Run, the current version is checked with the previously installed powertoys version and if it is lesser than the current Version the storage files are deleted. \n* Each file has an associated version file, based on which we decide if we should delete the file or load data from it.\n* This condition can be changed once we have a portable version of powerToys.\n\n<!-- Please review the items on the PR checklist before submitting-->\n## PR Checklist\n* [x] Applies to #4424\n* [x] CLA signed.

This could be a xaml islands issue.\n- The other alternative would be to modify the keyboardhook.cpp logic to add another thread which checks if the Settings window has been closed and if so it terminates the thread however that makes the code less re-usable and can affect perf. Plus extra threads is what caused the bug in the first place so I'm wary of adding logic like that.\n- The easy way that I implemented was to call Environment.Exit after App.run has completed. This ensures that the entire process gets terminated along with all threads. We still need to keep the Unloaded logic in to avoid threads being added every time someone changes the settings page, so the Environment.Exit scenario mainly fixes the scenario mentioned in the summary specifically.\n- I also found that this seems to the minimized settings not terminating issue (#4430 ) - dont know why this happens but it looks like the minimized case also results in some threads not being terminated. In addition to that this bug wasn't reproducible when the process was attached to the debugger so I can't 100% validate what threads were causing the issue.\n\n<!-- Describe how you validated the behavior.

This is happening because of the change in #4302 . When `apply_general_settings` is called, the modules() variable is empty (since that is loaded only after `runner()` is called), because of which the save to json step stores the enabled module set as empty. This results in all modules getting enabled. To avoid this an extra arg was added to that method, which is by default true. If it is set to false, we do not save to json. Since the default arg is true, the change only affects this particular function call.\n\n<!-- Other than the issue solved, is this relevant to any other issues/existing PRs? --> \n## References\n\n<!-- Please review the items on the PR checklist before submitting-->\n## PR Checklist\n* [X] Applies to #4523 \n* [X] CLA signed.

However, for classes, lists (Exclusing CollectionList), the PropertyChanged interface is not implemented by default so we have to manually implement it. Failing to do so, would result in a memory leak.\n- In our case, there were two bindings, one to a `List<ContextMenuItemViewModel>` and `ICommand` object bindings which did not implement the PropertyChanged interface. Therefore, there was a strong reference to each result object as the view model was strongly referenced by these objects even after they were no longer in scope.\n- In this PR, the propertychanged functionality is implemented in the setter of the above two objects.\n\n<!-- Describe how you validated the behavior.

Even if it increases above that it is eventually collected by the GC and averages to around 240/250 MB. Without context menu items, the mem consumption is around 190 MB, which makes the increase reasonable as memory is needed to implement the added functionality of context menu items.\n- The way this was validated is by entering the letter `a` as the query text and pressing the down arrow key, till we loop through all the results. On doing the same thing without this change, the memory consumption increases to over 350 MB.\n- To clarify, the memory consumption by PT Run still increases when we scroll through the results, however, it does get freed by the GC eventually, which was previously not happening due to the binding.\n\n- Added test to validate that the `OnPropertyChanged` function is called when ICommand is set.", "NaN"], ["4602", "Now working on 0.19.1", "Enrico Giordani", "enricogior", "06/30/20, 04:40:17 PM", "<!-- Enter a brief description/summary of your PR here.

Earlier some part of this code was added during the prototyping phase but was commented out for earlier releases. With this PR, it is possible to use app-specific shortcuts however you will need to add code to the KBM constructor to create the shortcut remapping as it has not been exposed in the UI yet.\nIn order to try this locally look at this code snippet from the constructor https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/blob/9b79ce37756b0a76385851312c2e8ee55380252a/src/modules/keyboardmanager/dll/dllmain.cpp#L71-L84\n\nTests have been added in the same format that has been changed in #4592  \n\n<!-- Please review the items on the PR checklist before submitting-->\n## PR Checklist\n* [X] Applies to #4228 \n* [X] CLA signed.

As implemented earlier the logic is to check for app specific shortcuts first followed by OS level shortcuts. This is done because if the same shortcut is remapped at both levels then the app specific one has precedence if that app is in the foreground.\n- The step to check for the current process was changed to re-use code from common which was used by FZ for it's Snap Hotkey excluded apps feature. That however does not work for the case of Full screen UWP apps, so for that scenario we rely on the earlier implemented `GetGUIThreadInfo` method (more details in https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/issues/1766#issuecomment-605347205). This API works for those cases and doesn't return ApplicationFrameHost.exe however it could return internal exes used within the program (for example for old Edge it would return either Edge.exe or EdgeCP.exe depending on the part of the UI in focus). This is why we first use `GetForegroundWindow` and then use the other method only if it fails.\n- To make app-specific logic test-able, a GetForegroundProcess was added to the input interface which internally calls `GetCurrentApplication`. This allows us to mock this method in the test project by just setting some process name as the foreground process for that function. When I set this to just return the string name, it would goes runtime errors on the test project in `debug_heap` with `__acrt_first_block == header`. Based on [this stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/35311928), this would happen if allocation happens in one dll's code space and deallocation happens in another. One way to avoid this is to change both the projects to MD (multi threaded dll) instead of MT(multi threaded), however that results in many compile-time errors since all the PT projects are configured as MT. To solve this, the `GetForegroundProcess` was rewritten such that its argument is the output variable, and we allocate memory for that string within the `AppSpecificHandler` method rather than in that function.\n- The process checking step was tweaked further such that we check for an exact match and check for an exact match without the process file extension.\n- `AddAppSpecificShortcut` and `ClearAppSpecificShortcuts` methods were added, which are used for manually validating and which will be used once the UI is available.\n\n## Tests\nTwo tests were added for AppSpecificShortcuts. Since it internally calls the same handler as OSLevelShortcuts, we do not need to re-test all the scenarios tested for that method.\n- If an app-specific shortcut remapping is added, the shortcut should be remapped if that shortcut is invoked and that app is in focus\n- If an app-specific shortcut remapping is added, the shortcut should not be remapped if that shortcut is invoked but that app is not in focus\n\n## Pending work\nSince this is the first PR for this feature, there is still a lot of pending work and a couple of issues have also been observed. The following are the list of known issues and pending work (separate issues to be created for each of them):\n- App specific shortcuts does not have a UI - for the first prototype UI we plan to add it as a textbox where you would enter the exe. This would be further improved eventually to a dropdown with all apps.\n- After adding it in the UI, the shortcuts need to persist in JSON (#4713)\n- If someone remaps Ctrl+A to Alt+Tab (or basically the MappedTo is anything that makes the current app lose focus) for say Outlook, then when you hit Ctrl+A, Alt+Tab gets triggered, but after that outlook is no longer in focus, so when you release Ctrl on your keyboard it does not remap. So only Alt down and Tab down get sent, but Alt up and Tab up never get sent. This results in the OS thinking those keys are still pressed. This would also apply to other shortcuts like minimize or Alt+F4 or some app may also have some specific shortcut which makes it lose focus for some reason. This is an important scenario to solve which didn't affect OS level shortcuts. The ideal way to fix this would be to tweak the logic such that once a remapped shortcut is invoked, we don't check the focus aspect until that shortcut has completed invoking (i.e. the modifier is released).

What does it fix/what does it change/how was it tested (even manually, if necessary)? -->\n## Summary of the Pull Request\nThis PR reworks the KeyboardHook and HotkeyManager interop classes to a much more simplistic form, which uses GetAsyncKeyState. The following behavior has been changed:\n- Earlier the KeyboardHook class used to create a second thread, and the hook would add events to a queue and the thread would process these events. This could be a potential source of perf and concurrency issues when it comes to keyboard events. Now this has been avoided by directly processing the event in the low level hook itself rather than having an extra thread for it. (Similar to what is done for other hooks in PowerToys).\n- Earlier the HotkeyManager would process every key event and and store its state in a variable. This had a major issue that it could cause hotkeys to be fired even with the incorrect order for example, <kbd>Space</kbd> followed by <kbd>Win</kbd> for <kbd>Win+Space</kbd> which shouldn't happen. This stored state based approach could have other issues as well, which is why it has been changed to use GetAsyncKeyState for all the modifiers and we only consider the last keydown event as the \"action key\" (Space in the above example). This is the same approach used by KBM and FZ.\n\n<!-- Please review the items on the PR checklist before submitting-->\n## PR Checklist\n* [X] Applies to #4578 \n* [X] CLA signed.

There is however room for further improvement in these classes. One would be to update the `KeyboardEvent` data structure to be more similar to what we use for `LowLevelKeyboardEvent`, so that more information can be considered rather than just the virtual key code and the `WPARAM`.\n- Since we no longer have the additional thread, we can remove the Environment.Exit(0) statement in Settings added in #4496 . I manually validated that the process terminates correctly,.\n\n<!-- Describe how you validated the behavior.

What does it fix/what does it change/how was it tested (even manually, if necessary)? -->\n## Summary of the Pull Request\nThis PR fixes a scenario where a user could remap Alt+A->Ctrl+A, Alt+V->Ctrl+V and if you press Alt+A, release A and press V, Ctrl+V was not getting invoked. This was happening because when we fixed Alt+Tab style shortcuts in #3965, we changed the behavior such that we release the remapped modifier only after a key apart from the invoked shortcut's keys are pressed. When this would happen, we would reset the keyboard state to whichever keys should be physically pressed at that time, however we were sending all the keys including the latest pressed key (V in the example), with the `KEYBOARDMANAGER_SHORTCUT_FLAG`, because of which when the system received Alt+V it would not remap it to Ctrl+V. The fix involves removing the flag for that particular key event. We still keep the shortcut flag for all the key events before that so that we don't reinvoke the initial shortcut and cause an infinite recursion.\nComments have been updated to clarify the flag usage and two test cases have been added to capture the scenario.\n\n<!-- Please review the items on the PR checklist before submitting-->\n## PR Checklist\n* [X] Applies to #4647 \n* [X] CLA signed.

When one thread calls `UseNewSettings` with value as 0 and the other calls with value as 1, one of the threads returns `true` and the other returns `false`.\n- The below code forces one thread to set the `isAPIContractVxAvailableInitialized` value to `true` and yields to the other thread before setting the value for `isAPIContractVxAvailable`, leaving it to be `false`. Now the second thread has `isAPIContractVxAvailableInitialized` set to true, because of the other thread and thinks that it already has the correct value for `isAPIContractVxAvailable`(which is false) and returns with that value, but that is incorrect as the other thread had not calculated the value of `isAPIContractVxAvailable` yet.\n\n```\nfoo.lock();\n    while (value && !done)\n    {\n        foo.unlock();\n        std::this_thread::yield();\n        std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(1000));\n        foo.lock();\n    }\n    foo.unlock();\n\n    static bool isAPIContractVxAvailableInitialized = false;\n    static bool isAPIContractVxAvailable = false;\n\n    foo.lock();\n    done = true;\n    foo.unlock();\n\n    foo.lock();\n    while (!value && !set)\n    {\n        foo.unlock();\n        std::this_thread::yield();\n        std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(1000));\n        foo.lock();\n    }\n    foo.unlock();\n\n    if (!isAPIContractVxAvailableInitialized)\n    {\n        isAPIContractVxAvailableInitialized = true;\n\n        foo.lock();\n        set = true;\n        foo.unlock();\n\n        std::this_thread::yield();\n        std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(1000));\n        isAPIContractVxAvailable = winrt::Windows::Foundation::Metadata::ApiInformation::IsApiContractPresent(L\"Windows.Foundation.UniversalApiContract\", APIVersion);\n    }\n\n    return isAPIContractVxAvailable;\n\n```\n\n**Some Points to note** -\n- The os-detection dll is being used by ImageResizer and other than that only one settings thread is supposed to call the UseNewSettings function. However, this race condition **could not** have been caused by ImageResizer because static variables are not shared across dlls, but only across threads. So the imageResizer is accessing another set of static variables which are not the same as the settings thread. \n- This implies that there is probably some path in the settings code which is calling the `std::thread(run_settings_window).detach();` function again before ` g_settings_process_id = process_info.dwProcessId;` is set leading to multiple settings windows to open. \n- I'm not sure what that path is but i was able to reproduce the multiple settings window condition by artificially calling this line of code `std::thread(run_settings_window).detach();` before the `g_settings_process_id` is called. Since many of the users have both the settings windows showing up in their issues, I feel there is still a corner case probably where multiple settings open up and if they happen in the interlocked fashion as forced above using mutexes, then we can end up with old and new settings versions.\n- With the help of the mutexes and artificially calling the `std::thread(run_settings_window).detach();` function once, I was able to get both the settings windows. However, without this artificial function call, I was unable to reproduce it by clicking on the sys tray icon multiple times. \n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28739210/86485944-e6f18080-bd0e-11ea-82a8-cfd5728579c9.png)\n\n\n\n<!-- Describe how you validated the behavior.

The buffer now stores the two shortcuts and the target app name in each row.\n- Added an additional column to the Remap shortcuts grid structure, and a TextBox is added in each row for this. The width is set to be same as the drop down\n- In the shortcut validation logic, to check for conflicts between different remaps (such as Ctrl+C remapped twice or Ctrl(left)+C remapped and Ctrl+C remapped), we add an extra condition that the check needs to be done only if the target app name matches. This ensures that the same shortcut can be remapped to different shortcuts for different target apps.\n- Many function argument lists were changed to include the TextBox element as well as the modified shortcut buffer data type.\n- In order to revalidate the shortcuts in a row when the text in the target app TextBox changes, the logic in `SetSelectionHandler` was moved to a separate function. This iterates over all the shortcuts in `keyDropDownControlObjects` and validates each of them. For the TextBox, we invoke this function in the [`LostFocus`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.uielement.lostfocus?view=winrt-19041) handler, because for any change in text the control would have to be first in focus, so whenever a change is completed the `LostFocus` handler will be triggered. After validating we update the buffer. The [`TextChanged`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.controls.textbox.textchanged?view=winrt-19041) handler gets invoked on every time a character is added/removed, so it could lead to perf issues. It's better to validate the shortcut once the user has finished typing.\n- Added `AppSpecificShortcutRemapCount` event to telemetry\n- Updated the `OnClickAccept` function in EditShortcuts so that it creates app-specific buffers and then calls `CheckIfRemappingsAreValid` on each buffer.\n- All app name checks have been made case insensitive since users may not know the exact casing of the process name.\n- Column spacing and default window size was increased\n\n## Known Issues\n- Since we convert all the strings to lowercase, if you add a target app in which a letter is in uppercase, after exiting and re-opening the remap shortcuts window it will appear in lowercase.\n\n<!-- Describe how you validated the behavior. Add automated tests wherever possible, but list manual validation steps taken as well -->\n## Validation Steps Performed\nManually validated that all previous os level shortcut remapping works as expected.\nTo validate app-specific shortcuts works I used the following steps:\n- Add a new shortcut Ctrl+C to Ctrl+V, leave it as global.\n- Add a second shortcut. If you try typing Ctrl+C it should display a warning since it is already remapped. Change the target to msedge.exe. Now typing Ctrl+C in the first column should not display a warning (since there is no conflict for that app). Set the second column as Ctrl+A, and then save the remappings. Only the first remapping will appear in the landing page (since the settings dont save to JSON yet). Try Ctrl+C in Edge and in any other app. It should do Ctrl+A only in Edge and Ctrl+V everywhere else.\n- Open Remap Shortcuts again, it should show both the shortcuts and not just the os level shortcuts (since those remaps are stored in memory and not reloaded from JSON each time).\n- Change the target app for the second shortcut to Global.

The following is an example:\n`{\"remapKeys\":{\"inProcess\":[]},\"remapShortcuts\":{\"global\":[{\"originalKeys\":\"162;67\",\"newRemapKeys\":\"162;86\"},{\"originalKeys\":\"162;68\",\"newRemapKeys\":\"162;86\"}],\n\"appSpecific\":[{\"originalKeys\":\"162;67\",\"newRemapKeys\":\"162;86\",\"targetApp\":\"msedge\"},{\"originalKeys\":\"162;68\",\"newRemapKeys\":\"162;86\",\"targetApp\":\"chrome\"}]\n}}`\nWhen we combine both the remap keys and shortcuts windows since we will need upgrade path logic at that point, we can refactor the JSON structure such that there is only one remap section and all the elements have a `targetApp` element.\n- While loading the JSON in the backend, separate try catch blocks have been added for each section, so that even if Single Key Remaps fail to load, OS level shortcuts can load, etc. This allows the upgrade path logic to work since an exception will occur while loading app specific shortcuts but the other remaps will not be affected.\n- On the PT Settings side, a new data model `AppSpecificKeysDataModel` was added which inherits from the old `KeysDataModel`, with an additional field for `TargetApp`. The `GetOriginalKeys` and `GetNewRemapKeys` methods were implemented which returned the base method because there were warnings on the UI Xaml side which said the method did not exist of that data model. The `appSpecific` JSON property was linked to this data model.\n- The Remap shortcuts ListView was modified such that it has an additional arrow followed by the target app name\n- The ListView itemSource was linked to a combination of the os level remap list and the app specific remap list, where the os level remaps have the target app name \"All Apps\".\n- Since the data template used for Remap Keys could no longer be reused for Remap Shortcuts, a separate data template was made for this listview.\n- Horizontal scrolling was added for the listview since with the additional target app column it could easily overflow.\n\n## Known Issues\n- After saving the settings, the order in which shortcuts appear will not be the same in the landing page and on re-opening the Remap Shortcuts UI because it loads the OS level shortcuts first and then the app specific shortcuts.\n- Columns were not aligned in the list view since KBM was released, however it is more noticeable now.\n\n<!-- Describe how you validated the behavior. Add automated tests wherever possible, but list manual validation steps taken as well -->\n## Validation Steps Performed\n- Opened Remap Shortcuts and the Keyboard Manager landing page with the old JSON file to ensure no exceptions occur in the upgrade path.\n- Added multiple shortcuts with and without target apps, and checked if the landing page was updated and if re-opening Remap shortcuts shows the correct remaps\n- Closed PT and re-opened to ensure all the saved mappings are loaded\n- Added three key shortcut remaps with long app names to check if horizontal scrolling is working", "NaN"], ["4843", "Fixed the broken link for example_settings.png", "Kamesh Kotwani", "kameshkotwani", "07/08/20, 05:31:53 AM", "Due to changes in the directory structure of the `doc/images` folder, the link for `examples_settings.png` was broken and image was not showing up.

In the cpp side, when these objects are constructed the IInspectable members are initialized to their corresponding UI controls (ex: `IInspectable x = StackPanel();`), and all the members can be accessed by typecasts using the `as` member function (ex: `x.as<StackPanel>().Children().Append();`).

What does it fix/what does it change/how was it tested (even manually, if necessary)? -->\n## Summary of the Pull Request\nThis PR handles the app-specific shortcut scenario where an app loses focus when a remapped shortcut is invoked.\nEarlier the scenario was as follows:\n- User remaps Ctrl+A->Alt+Tab for msedge (or any other shortcut, which causes an app to lose focus. Alt+Tab and Alt+F4 is the most common example but there could be many shortcuts like this considering this is for specific apps).\n- User presses Ctrl+A (key down) while msedge is in foreground. KBM checks and finds that msedge is in foreground, so it remaps this and sends Alt down followed by Tab down. This causes the task switcher to appear and msedge is no longer in foreground.\n- User releases A or Ctrl key (key up). KBM checks and finds that msedge is not in foreground, so it does not know that call the msedge app-specific remap. This results in the OS thinking Alt and Tab are in key down state and the user needs to manually press Alt and Tab to release those keys.\n\n<!-- Please review the items on the PR checklist before submitting-->\n## PR Checklist\n* [X] Applies to #4714 \n* [X] CLA signed.

Whenever a key event occurs after this we send it to that app-specific handler irrespective of the app in focus. Once the shortcut has been released we reset the target app name. This ensures that whenever an app-specific shortcut has been triggered, it will get released when the user releases the keys irrespective of the app loses focus or terminating. This avoids the keys getting stuck behavior.\n- Two tests were added for this behavior. First test is to verify that the `activatedApp` variable gets saved correctly on invoking an app-specific shortcut. Second test validates the above scenario where foreground app changes after key down events of a remapped shortcut.\n- The `activatedApp` variable was added as a member of `KeyboardManagerState` since that is the only global object used for KBM.\n- To avoid debug CRT errors due to memory allocation/deallocation across DLL boundaries, this member was initialized to a large size string in the test project.\n\n## Known Quirks\n- If the user invokes an app-specific shortcut and switches foreground apps while holding down the modifier then they will still be able to continue invoking that app-specific shortcut remap until they release the modifier even though the app isn't in focus. This behavior can't be avoided since fixing that will cause remaps like Alt+Tab to break.\n\n<!-- Describe how you validated the behavior.

Issue number where discussion took place: #xxx\n\n<!-- Provide a more detailed description of the PR, other things fixed or any additional comments/features here -->\n## Detailed Description of the Pull Request / Additional comments\nThe changes made in this PR are as follows -\n* The `win32Storage` list has been modified to use a class, called `Win32ProgramRepository` which implements `ListRespository` and `IProgramRepository` just like in packaged applications. With this change all the items are stored in a concurrent dictionary and adding, deleting, indexing all programs has become easier. As concurrent dictionary is thread safe, we do not need locks while setting/deleting items.\n* When a Win32 application is added, there can be a chance of duplicates. To avoid this situation, the `GetHashCode()` function of Win32 has been overridden so that the custom Win32 GetHashCode() function is used. This ensures that no duplicates are present in the list even when we actively add or delete apps.\n* The `Win32ProgramRepository` and `Win32ProgramRepositoryHelper` classes have been added to watch certain locations and trigger `Created`, `Deleted` or `Renamed` events whenever such an operation is performed on a file. To prevent these events from being triggered for non app type files, we add `Filters`. These filters raise events only for those particular type of applications. [Filters](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.filesystemwatcher.filters?view=netcore-3.1)\n* The `FileSystemWatchers` filter out exe, lnk, appred-ms and url type files and call the `GetAppFromPath(path)` function which has been added to the Win32 class. This function returns the corresponding Win32 item which can be added to the list. \n* Wrappers and interfaces have been added to `FileSystemWatcher`, `System.IO.File` and `FileVersionInfo` classes so that they can be mocked and tested.\n* `ShellLinkHelper` is implementing the interface `IShellLinkHelper` so that the Win32 shortcut programs (lnk) can be tested.\n\n* For shortcut apps, `GetAppFromPath` doesn't give us the expected FullPath for the deleted and renamed application and therefore it must be treated in a separate way because the FullPath is set using the ShellLinkHelper and if the file does not exist we cannot extract the **exe FullPath** from the lnkFile.\n* For `Deleted` apps since we have no more information to go on, we iterate through all the programs and remove the one which has the same lnkResolved path.\n* For `Renamed` apps, we have more information about the existing app, so we construct what could have been the old app so that we can remove it from the list. This is done so that we have an app which has the same name, exe name and full path as the app which was added so that the hashcodes are the same.\n<!-- Describe how you validated the behavior.

It is set to behave similar to single key remaps, i.e. it gets invoked even if you have other keys pressed.\n    - If the target is a shortcut (by using std::get to check the data type of the std::variant), for the keydown event we first send the dummy key and then set the modifiers followed by the action key.\n    - If the key is released, first send keyup for the action key, followed by the modifier keys and then send the dummy key.\n- The method added (in #3397 )  for avoiding the Caps Lock and Ctrl key issues with IME keyboards was tweaking to reduce code duplication, and it was added in all appropriate places for key to shortcut, shortcut to shortcut and shortcut to key methods along with tests for each of those scenarios.\n- The shortcut to key logic was added along with the shortcut remap function. It is set to behave similar to single key remaps, i.e. it gets invoked even if you have other keys pressed. The use case example for this is, if a user remaps <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>`</kbd> -> <kbd>Alt</kbd>, they would need to be able to use it in combination with other keys for it to be useful.\n    - When the shortcut is pressed, we send the dummy key and release the modifiers, and then send the target key.\n    - When one of the original shortcut modifiers is released, release the target key and set the original modifiers (except the released one) and then the dummy key. The action key does not have to be sent since it would generate its own key message since you are holding down the key.\n    - If the action key is pressed again, send the target key again\n    - If the action key is released, then reset the keyboard state back to the original shortcut by sending the original modifiers and a dummy key. This is different from the shortcut to shortcut behavior since here there is only one target key.\n    - If any other key is pressed, no logic is required. This is because of the behavior difference since it can be invoked even if other keys are pressed.\n- Since the shortcut to key remaps can be invoked even when other keys are pressed, it is required to ensure that if you remap a superset shortcut, that should be considered for the remap. Example: Shift+A -> Ctrl, and Alt+Shift+A->Alt+V, then pressing Alt+Shift+A should invoke the second remap. To solve this, we should first check the larger original shortcut remaps, and then the smaller ones. This was done by maintaining a vector of the source shortcuts sorted on the shortcut size. This vector is modified whenever a shortcut remap is added and it is re-sorted on that change. This was done for efficiency, so that the sorting logic doesn't need to be done on every key event, instead its only done after applying remaps from the settings window.\n- The UI methods were tweaked to make them reusable for single key remap and shortcut remaps. For both windows, the control on the right side of the window is considered as a hybrid control. It now allows setting an action key at the start (in which case no other drop down is added). If a modifier is pressed it adds an empty drop down, however you can press apply since this is considered as a complete key even though its an incomplete shortcut. The other change is that you can apply a remap if there are multiple blank drop downs but one is non-empty. The last change is you can set a drop down to `None` even if there are exactly 2 drop downs (earlier it had to have atleast 3). No extra warning is needed analogous to \"remapping to itself\" for s2k and k2s.\n- JSON logic was updated. We check if the string has a `;` in it to distinguish between key and shortcut, since key combinations are semi-colon separated in the settings config format.\n- The detect shortcut backend had to be tweaked and an additional keyboard manager UI state had to be added to support the Type Shortcut  dialog in the Remap a key window.\n\n## Tests Added\n- Added tests to SingleKeyRemappingTests, to ensure that correct shortcut keyboard states are set for key to shortcut remaps (2 key and 3 key cases separately). A test for Caps Lock/Ctrl IME issue was also added for k2s scenario.\n- Changed the OSLevelShortcutRemappingTests hook proc to contain logic to ignore the keys with suppress flag. This is required since that logic is actually done in a parent function, and not including it can cause recursive loops for certain remaps.\n- Tests analogous to s2s were added for s2k to test the correct keyboard states are set on pressing the shortcut, and on releasing parts of the shortcut. Tests were also added to validate the behavior when pressed in combination with other keys since it should be invoked even if other keys are pressed (separate tests for if the key was pressed before the shortcut or after the shortcut). Tests were also added to validate the logic where a larger superset shortcut was also remapped and to make sure that the larger shortcut is invoked rather than the smaller one when those keys are pressed.\n- Tests added for shortcuts pressed consecutively in all cases i.e. s2s, s2k; s2k, s2k; s2k, s2s\n- Tests added in for Caps Lock/Ctrl IME issue in s2s, s2k logic.\n\n## Pending decisions\n- Should key to shortcut be invoked only when the exact key is pressed (like shortcut to shortcut), or even with combination of keys (like key to key)?\n    - If it behaves like key to key, then it can be used for scenarios like shortening a large set of shortcuts. Example: remap CapsLock -> Ctrl+A. and you can use Shift+Caps Lock, for Ctrl+Shift+A, etc, hence shortening all shortcuts containing Ctrl+A by one key,\n    - If it behaves like shortcut to shortcut, the benefit is that you could set a key such that when pressed alone it activates some shortcut but when used with other keys the original shortcuts would still work. Example: <kbd>A</kbd> -> <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd>, but pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> triggers the original behavior. **The issue however with implementing this is that if the remapped key is pressed first and then another key is pressed in combination, the remap will get invoked first so the shortcut would get invoked once. Example: remap Alt -> Ctrl+V, and you try pressing Alt+D, the Alt remap gets invoked. Instead this would need to be tweaked such that it only invoked when the key is released to avoid off behavior.**\n\n<!-- Describe how you validated the behavior.

Issue number where discussion took place: #xxx\n\n<!-- Provide a more detailed description of the PR, other things fixed or any additional comments/features here -->\n## Detailed Description of the Pull Request / Additional comments\n- An `Argument Exception` was being thrown when when `package.InstalledLocation.Path` was being accessed. It threw a value is not found in the expected range exception. \n- That exception is not of type `ArgumentNullException` or `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` so other than catching the exception, no other check could be performed.\n- While reading the app manifest file, it was being read with `deny_write` STGM constant which prevented any other process from modifying it. This was causing all the appxmanifest.xml files to be locked by PowerToys run. Changing it to `deny_none` fixed this issue. Ref - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/stg/stgm-constants. We will not face an issue where we would try to read an incompletely installed packaged app because we proceed only if the installation is complete (using args.IsComplete).\n- There was a similar issue while loading the img icon into a bitmap Image format. Once the image was loaded it could not be deleted, throwing this error - \n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28739210/87977479-aa01e980-ca83-11ea-96ba-57e00e705ae2.png)\n- To fix this, instead of passing the uri directly, passing the file as a memory stream fixed the issue.

This time was variant from system to system, hence this has been removed.\n- We are leveraging the `LastWrite` NotifyFilter of the `Changed` event handler. This is triggered **twice** for most applications because the app is written in chunks. We are leveraging this only for the internet shortcut application and not for other app types, such as exe, appref etc.\n- Trying out other notify filters, such as size triggered the event many more times (about 6-7) in comparison to the LastWrite notify filter.\n- The `Changed` event is not triggered when an app is deleted/Renamed, only when it is installed.\n- This approach is better than using a retry block based on a timer for a number of reasons -\n       1. It is now not machine specific/app specific because there is no timer involved.\n       2. We are processing events as soon as they come and there is no delay. The delay might have lead to an overflow of the fileSystemWatcher buffer (though unlikely considering that we are processing applications only).\n       3.

What does it fix/what does it change/how was it tested (even manually, if necessary)? -->\n## Summary of the Pull Request\nThis PR fixes the issue of the autocomplete text appearing unaligned when typing in an RTL language. To resolve this as per the suggestion in https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/issues/3659#issuecomment-633273757, [whenever the input language changes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.input.inputlanguagemanager.inputlanguagechanged?view=netcore-3.1), the `QueryTextBox` and `AutoCompleteTextBlock` flow direction's are set to the [flow direction](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.frameworkelement.flowdirection?view=netcore-3.1#System_Windows_FrameworkElement_FlowDirection) of the new input language. The same is also done initially in the `OnLoaded` method. While this solves the scenario in the issue, it still does not solve all text alignment issues with respect to localization. The behavior works for strings that are completely in one type of language but the alignment goes wrong if it is a mixed string.\n\n- Searching for `Offi` in English-US\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32061677/88233161-07389f00-cc2c-11ea-9260-9778fd27bde9.png)\n\n- Searching for `\u0636\u0635\u062b\u0642\u0641\u063a` in Arabic. (Typed as qwerty, file was named qwerty.txt in arabic).\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32061677/88233243-2800f480-cc2c-11ea-836a-73ce039d89e7.png)\n\n## Unresolved Issues\n- Because of the punctuation rules in RTL languages the tag appears as `...Start Typing`.\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32061677/88233299-47981d00-cc2c-11ea-90ba-dcc923a0c944.png)\n- In some languages like Arabic when characters are written consecutively they change a bit. In this screenshot you can see that even though the actual key pressed is the same, and the autocomplete logic matches it, the last character doesn't look identical so the alignment of autocomplete text seems off. An similar but not equivalent example in a European language would be how the accent grave symbol is actually composed of ` and a. When you type `a, it gets converted to \u00e0 in those languages.\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32061677/88233258-32bb8980-cc2c-11ea-9ef1-83c7d951f529.png)\n- For mixed strings the behavior can be weird. The situation in the screenshot occurs if I type in \"offi\" in English US and then switch to Arabic, the alignment will be off. Since there are a lot of cases involved in handling this, I did not make fixes for this. I think we should think through before trying to fix this so that we can do it in the correct \"globalized\" way @crutkas @ryanbodrug-microsoft  @saahmedm . I think Start Menu does this really well.\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32061677/88233333-58e12980-cc2c-11ea-9025-2e6290d91d45.png)\nFor one, in Start Menu it switches the LTR vs RTL positioning only if the textbox is empty. You can still get into the above situation in Start Menu by switching to Arabic, type some character, switch to English (because a character is there it remains in RTL format), then delete the text and type in an English search phrase. The search cursor moves to the correct position to match the autocomplete text like in this screenshot.\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32061677/88234542-ef621a80-cc2d-11ea-8709-0daba5491f01.png)\n\n\n<!-- Please review the items on the PR checklist before submitting-->\n## PR Checklist\n* [X] Applies to #3659\n* [X] CLA signed.

Issue number where discussion took place: #xxx\n\n<!-- Provide a more detailed description of the PR, other things fixed or any additional comments/features here -->\n## Detailed Description of the Pull Request / Additional comments\nThis PR partially solves the issue of Clean no longer working for the XAML island based projects. In this PR incremental clean has been removed from the PowerLauncher `Directory.Build.targets` file as it is no longer a XAML island based project. Hence, we will not face the double compile issue and since the empty incremental clean step has been removed, clean works as expected for the launcher project.\n\n## Issues with removing incremental clean for the Settings project\nClean still does not work for the settings project. I have tried out multiple approaches but in all the cases, it seems like we hit either the double compilation issue or the clean not working issue.\n1. The present approach that we have for the settings Runner project is that the `IncrementalClean` step is overridden with an empty target so that we no longer face the double compilation issue. Since the same incremental clean step is used as a depency Target for Clean, clean does not work as expected.\n2. I tried to include the following in the `Directory.Build.props` file. \n```\n<Project>\n   <Target\n     Name=\"ForceAssignProjectConfigurationBeforeSplitProjectReferencesByFileExistence_KLUDGE\" \n     BeforeTargets=\"_SplitProjectReferencesByFileExistence\" \n     DependsOnTargets=\"AssignProjectConfiguration\" />\n</Project>\n```\nThis solved the incremental clean issue but it still had the double compilation issue.\n3. The next approach that I tried was to remove the incrementalClean target from the CoreBuild target dependencies. This fixed the double compilation issue but Clean was still not working as expected.\n```\n<PropertyGroup>\n    <CoreBuildDependsOn>\n      BuildOnlySettings;\n      PrepareForBuild;\n      PreBuildEvent;\n      ResolveReferences;\n      PrepareResources;\n      ResolveKeySource;\n      Compile;\n      ExportWindowsMDFile;\n      UnmanagedUnregistration;\n      GenerateSerializationAssemblies;\n      CreateSatelliteAssemblies;\n      GenerateManifests;\n      GetTargetPath;\n      PrepareForRun;\n      UnmanagedRegistration;\n      PostBuildEvent\n    </CoreBuildDependsOn>\n  </PropertyGroup>\n  <Target\n      Name=\"CoreBuild\"\n      DependsOnTargets=\"$(CoreBuildDependsOn)\">\n\n    <OnError ExecuteTargets=\"_TimeStampAfterCompile;PostBuildEvent\" Condition=\"'$(RunPostBuildEvent)'=='Always' or '$(RunPostBuildEvent)'=='OnOutputUpdated'\"/>\n    <OnError ExecuteTargets=\"_CleanRecordFileWrites\"/>\n\n  </Target>\n```\n4. The other approach that I tried was to override the `CleanDependsOn` Property as follows - \n```\n  <PropertyGroup>\n    <CleanDependsOn>\n        $(CleanDependsOn);\n        CustomClean\n    </CleanDependsOn>\n  </PropertyGroup>\n\n  <Target Name=\"CustomClean\"\n          DependsOnTargets=\"_CleanGetCurrentAndPriorFileWrites\" />\n```\nThe idea behind this was that we depend on the same targets that Incremental Clean used to depend on ie. `_CleanGetCurrentAndPriorFileWrites`. Ideally this should work as we are implementing a custom target which behaved just like incremental clean and are calling it when the Clean target is triggered. However, even this did not fix the clean issue.\n\nHence, this PR is only for Launcher and the clean not working issue still remains for the Settings.UI.Runner project.\n\n<!-- Describe how you validated the behavior.

Add automated tests wherever possible, but list manual validation steps taken as well -->\n## Validation Steps Performed\n- To replicate the Dispatcher exception, I added a `throw new Exception();` statement after the _viewModel.Query() is invoked in the dispatcher (MainViewModel.xaml.cs file). On typing in the search box, an exception is raised, which shows the error reporting window but does not crash the PT Run process, like it used to before.\n\n```\n private async Task DelayedCheck(DateTime latestTimeOfTyping)\n        {\n            await Task.Delay(millisecondsToWait).ConfigureAwait(false);\n            if (latestTimeOfTyping.Equals(s_lastTimeOfTyping))\n            {\n                await System.Windows.Application.Current.Dispatcher.BeginInvoke(new Action(() =>\n                {\n                    _viewModel.Query();\n                }));\n            }\n        }\n```\n- Previously any exception in the dispatcher was leading to PT Run crashing. However, now it is handled and shows a window with information about the exception raised in the dispatcher. \n- \n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28739210/88348998-bc8a5600-cd03-11ea-8d6c-3e658ccb4d31.png)\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28739210/88349000-c01ddd00-cd03-11ea-8059-1b8f07b902b8.png)", "NaN"], ["5201", "Add telemetry event for measuring time taken to display PT Run", "Arjun Balgovind", "arjunbalgovind", "07/24/20, 07:38:17 PM", "<!-- Enter a brief description/summary of your PR here.

In both these events, the time is only recorded for making PT Run visible, not for hiding it.\n\nSince the Stopwatch for measuring the time had to be started in the view model's `OnHotkey` method and stopped in the MainWindow.xaml.cs OnVisibilityChanged handler, the Stopwatch variable was added as a member to the view model, and it is accessed by public TimerStart/Stop methods.\n\n<!-- Please review the items on the PR checklist before submitting-->\n## PR Checklist\n* [X] Applies to #5198 \n* [X] CLA signed.

However, Windows doesn't update its internal app list immediately, so we must sleep for 3s before showing the first notification. That will be fixed when we know how to register the app via registry (perhaps next Monday). Also, there's a known issue that we cannot determine if the bootstrapper was launched manually or during the update procedure, so for 0.20 the updating user will need to click through the msi dialogs. For later versions that's fixed by adding -silent flag during update.\n\n<!-- Describe how you validated the behavior.

It created a child process, waited for its termination, then read its stdout from an anonymous pipe. That didn't work for some users, causing `dotnet` process to hang indefinitely, specifically for those who had so many dotnet versions installed, that `dotnet --list-runtimes` output exceeded the default anonymous pipe buffer size - 4KB. \n\nThat caused dotnet process to block on some printf/Writeline call until the pipe buffer has space again. However, we were waiting indefinitely for the process to terminate instead of reading from the pipe buffer, as a result, we've had a deadlock.\n\nThis PR fixes the issue by reworking `exec_and_read_output` to have a default `30s` timeout value and employs overlapped I/O, since `ReadFile` will block indefinitely if no data is available. It also detects child process termination to figure when it's no longer useful to wait the full timeout.

This was because many UI components did not have a `Automation Properties` set. \n* This [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10496106/why-automationproperties-are-needed-in-wpf) gives more information about why Automation Properties are needed.\n* In this PR the name Automation Property has been set for the UI components that were flagged by Accessibility Insights.\n* It is good practice to localize the Automation Properties so that screen readers can read out the component name in the correct language, which is the same as the rest of the components.

This was earlier inside the `ApplyRemappings` lambda in the EditKeyboardWindow file\n- `ApplyShortcutRemappings` - used to move the shortcut remappings from the buffer to the keyboard manager state. This was earlier inside the `ApplyRemappings` lambda in the EditShortcutWindow file\nNo logic changes have been made for the above methods, they have only been moved to another file. 23 tests were added for the above set of functions to take into account the different types of argument states.\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32061677/89558918-c020e100-d7c9-11ea-8d9a-1be1bc984d9d.png)\n\nThis PR refactors the key table and shortcut table validation logic to methods in a separate header file (`BufferValidationHelpers`) such that both the methods no longer require any UI elements arguments to be passed. Instead the UI elements are used to compute vector representations for the current set of selections in the drop downs and this was passed as an argument to the validate method.\n- `GetKeysFromStackPanel` was replaced with `GetSelectedIndicesFromStackPanel` which returns a vector of the indices selected in the set of drop downs. `GetKeyCodesFromSelectedIndices` was added to Helpers, such that `GetKeyCodesFromSelectedIndices` along with `GetSelectedIndicesFromStackPanel` can give the same result as `GetKeysFromStackPanel`.\n- `CheckRepeatedModifier` which earlier used UI elements as argument was moved to Helpers and refactored so that it takes the list of keys directly rather than calling `GetKeysFromStackPanel`.\n- The single key remap validation logic in the selection handler was moved to `ValidateAndUpdateKeyBufferElement`. This method validates the row as well as makes changes to the buffer based on the selection\n- The basic shortcut remap validation logic in `ValidateShortcutSelection` was moved to `ValidateShortcutBufferElement`.  As part of the refactoring to make it independent of the UI elements, the Add drop down and step for clearing the unused drop downs was moved out of this function. Instead a variable is return which stores the error type and the action that needs to be done, and this action is process in `ValidateShortcutSelection` since these actions need to interact with the UI. This only validates the row, but does not update the buffer, since that is done in `SetSelectionHandler` and is more tied to the UI, so it cannot be unit tested along with the above. \n- Added 44 tests for `ValidateAndUpdateKeyBufferElement` and `ValidateShortcutBufferElement` to cover all the warning cases and normal entry cases. This includes setting a drop down to action key/modifier key/Null(blank)/None and checking if a warning needs to be shown and if an action needs to be done (where action could be deleting a drop down, adding a drop down or clearing blank drop downs). The tests cover most of the scenarios occurring when one drop down is changing. Some scenarios have not been included  (which are very similar to some of the other cases)  since it would bloat the test file size (since its already 3000 lines of code).\n- To avoid bloating the test file size, some cases were combined into a single test, if they had the same drop down selection resulting in the same return values. For example, if selecting None on a dropdown resulted in the same return value irrespective of whether it was in the first/second column or if it was a hybrid column, these 3 scenarios were all added as separate Act/Assert lines in the same test.\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32061677/89560032-4853b600-d7cb-11ea-8d81-c699c85a8e96.png)\n\n## Validation Steps Performed\n\n_How does someone test & validate?_\n\n- Run the tests locally\n- Run KBM and try adding and removing remappings with \"Type\" or drop downs and apply the remappings.\n- After saving remappings, click the Remap button again to ensure the remappings load correctly.", "NaN"], ["5729", "Incremental fix for StyleCop on Infra", "Clint Rutkas", "crutkas", "08/07/20, 05:45:51 PM", "## Summary of the Pull Request\n\nFixes file names and classes don't match.  ~~All but PluginsSettings~~\n\n**Update:** synced with Ryan and we agreed on PluginSettings\n\nPluginsSettings file, it has weird consistancy naming\n\n- File name is PluginsSettings\n- Class is PluginsSettings\n- there is a public method UpdatePluginSettings\n\nnote \"Plugin\" vs \"Plugins\"\n\nI feel like it is PluginSettings as it is a dictionary of settings for plugins and i don't think that class itself is ever seralized\n\n\n\n## PR Checklist\n* [x] Applies to #5295\n* [x] CLA signed.

If a plugin uses this flag and implements this interface it can be used with similar behavior to indexer plugin.\n- For indexer we use a regex to filter out the LIKE query part of the SQL query. Initially while running all the plugins we run this faster version of indexer. After updating the list view with those results, we run each DelayedExecution plugin one by one and update the results along with it. If there is no change in the sql query after checking for LIKE query we do not update any results with the second query.\n- Adding scoring for indexer plugin as 0, -1, -2, etc., to ensure that ordering is maintained\n- Removed `_lock` in WindowsSearchAPI since there could be multiple instances of indexer query occurring. To avoid the error from OleDB throwing exceptions in ExecuteReader (https://github.com/microsoft/Launcher/pull/70) we add checks for whether the reader is closed. While testing, the exceptions were generally occurring only on the older queries which would get cancelled eventually. Otherwise this would cause the slower query from a previous execution to block the list view from updating when the next query is made since it will wait even for the fast indexer plugin.\n\n## Validation Steps Performed\n\n_How does someone test & validate?_\n- Tests passed and added tests for SimplifyQuery method.\n- Tested manually by adding artificial Thread.Sleep in the indexer plugin.", "NaN"], ["5750", "stylecop PowerLauncher whitespace tweaks", "Clint Rutkas", "crutkas", "08/07/20, 03:38:50 AM", "## Summary of the Pull Request\n\nwhitespace tweaks for powerlauncher\n\n## PR Checklist\n* [ ] Applies to #5295\n* [ ] CLA signed.

This was done because some apps only have white icons resulting in difficult visibility when displayed in Light theme mode. \n2. HC icons were prioritized to be displayed(if available) in high contrast modes. \n3. Code to plate the icons was added back from [Wox](https://github.com/jjw24/Wox/blob/master/Plugins/Wox.Plugin.Program/Programs/UWP.cs). This was modified to use plating color as the current windows accent color similar to the start menu if the background color is set as `transparent` in the manifest file.\n\n![cal_ptrun](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10995909/90425508-b1151b00-e074-11ea-9aac-4291a166f0a8.PNG)\n\n![messa_ptrun](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10995909/90425510-b1adb180-e074-11ea-87f4-68944c9c13ba.PNG)\n\n![spotify_ptrun](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10995909/90425618-e6ba0400-e074-11ea-8172-03645588673b.PNG)\n\n\n\n## Validation Steps Performed\n1.

If the first space separated item was an action keyword, then only a non global query would be executed. However, now we have a query being generated for each plugin. We execute global plugins along with the non global plugins as we have removed the space requirement following the action keyword.\n* A few symbols have been added to the search ignore regex of the indexer plugin. The symbols which have been added are >, < and : because when we search for `>cmd`, the indexer plugin is also executed now and it compared the filenames and returns those which are greated than cmd. This was leading to a delay. Also, filenames do not contain these symbols >, < and :. Hence queries containing these symbols can be ignored.\n* Previously the cancellation token was based on the query, however since we have a unique query for each plugin, the cancellation token is based on the queryText instead which is same for all plugins.\n\n## Validation Steps Performed\n\n_How does someone test & validate?_\n* Added  tests\n* manually validated it\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28739210/90420778-444a5280-e06d-11ea-9060-3e30a4b32a28.png)", "NaN"], ["6005", "[WarningsAsErrors] Getting Most online", "Clint Rutkas", "crutkas", "08/17/20, 08:11:41 PM", "## Summary of the Pull Request\n\nGetting the first grouping of projects with warnings as errors.\n\n## PR Checklist\n* [ ] Applies to #5969\n* [ ] CLA signed.

There was a tab related issue regarding the radio buttons where they were all not accessible by the keyboard. This was due to xaml islands. Replacing the `RadioButtons` control with a `StackPanel` and `TextBlock` fixed this issue. Now we can tab through all the elements and also use the arrow keys to navigate through the radio buttons in a cyclic manner.\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28739210/90569765-48f13280-e163-11ea-9b14-4dfa24b205ff.png)\n2. When using a screen reader to read the entire content of the general settings page, only the word `Dark` was being read.

Issue number where discussion took place: #xxx\n\n## Info on Pull Request\n\n_What does this include?_\n\nThe following changes have been made in this PR to fix the accessibility issues related to the FZ settings page -\n1. The Launch zones editor window did not have a name and it was being read out as button by the screen reader. This has been fixed by setting the automation property and it is now read as the 'Launch zones editor button', instead of only 'button'.\n2. The open zones editor window and the info glyph were throwing errors because their names were not set. If the name is not set the text is taken as the name, however special characters are not allowed so an accessible name had to be added for the glyph and the custom control. This custom control was being used in PT Run and Color picker as well. \n3. The drop down buttons and the text boxes related to them had the same Uid and name which has been fixed. This was preventing us from adding as accessible label to the drop down button.\n4. The image on the right showing the fancy zones windows was previously being read as 'graphic', now it has been made more accessible by adding more context to the image. It now reads 'FancyZones windows graphic'.\n\nThe following issues have been fixed:\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28739210/90665598-1c8bf380-e201-11ea-9112-ff5c8ddf7e33.png)\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28739210/90665603-1e55b700-e201-11ea-84cf-df2915ae0057.png)\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28739210/90665605-1eee4d80-e201-11ea-8292-1f3e2ab400ae.png)\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28739210/90665607-201f7a80-e201-11ea-8d07-380066f5b5ab.png)\n\n\n## Known Issues:\n* There is a keyboard trap when we enter the window which captures key strokes. We can't tab out of it.\n* If we run accessibility insights on FancyZones there are two issues that still appear which are related to XAML Islands, namely that an onscreen element must not have a null bounding rectangle property.\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28739210/90665577-1269f500-e201-11ea-9edf-756bf0c800b1.png)\n\n\n## Validation Steps Performed\n\n_How does someone test & validate?_\n* Install and run Accessibility insights.

The language identifiers have been hardcoded in, since localization will be done on a limited set of languages and PowerShell doesn't have appropriate APIs to auto-generate this information.\n- The files are added to a `Generated Files` folder so that they are skipped by .gitignore\n- A base resource.h and base rc file is required in order to add any basic syntax for the file as well as non-localizable resources.\n- The script generates new .h and .rc files by adding the string tables to these base files in the generated files folder.\n- The script has try-catch blocks in case a file read/write fails because of the file being in use by another process (such as VS)\n- The script checks if the content to be written to the file is different from the existing file to avoid rewriting.

This might impact a PR that is trying to remove the space between the action keyword and the search string (see \n\n## Info on Pull Request\n\nSee discussion in issue #5823. Changes most `plugin.json` files in the PowerToys Runner plug in to use `actionKeywords` rather than `actionKeyword`, and adds a non-global keyword as noted above.\n\n### Other Changes:\n\nTwo things were needed to make action keywords work properly. Hopefully, they do not impact other operations of PowerToys!\n\n- The WindowsWalker plugin was using `RawQuery` instead of `Query` to drive its searches. `RawQuery`, of course, contains the action keyword (like \":\"). Fixed by changing `RawQuery` to `Query`.\n- `QueryBuilder` adds all global plug-ins to the dictionary of plug-in list for each query. When a plugin is a member of both global and nonglobal lists, it can be added twice to the plugin-pair dictionary. This behavior is protected with a simple if statement to prevent double insertion.\n\n### Oustanding Issues:\n\nNeed advice: the current settings infrastructure stores the keywords in the user's settings file. This will override what changes are done here. Normally this is fine - however, there is no UI for altering the keywords. Someone who has already run `PowerToys` and wants to take advantage of this will have to edit the settings json file by hand.\n\n## Validation Steps Performed\n\nRan the tests and also tested by hand\n\n- Some tests failed before (and after) I made modifications: the fancyzones tests and the rename tests.", "NaN"], ["6131", "24 08 Squaash", null, "PrzemyslawTusinski", "08/24/20, 10:38:37 AM", "## Summary of the Pull Request\n\n_What is this about?_\n\n## PR Checklist\n* [ ] Applies to #xxx\n* [ ] CLA signed.

We generate \"old -> new\" version toast using `current_version_to_next_version`. It's only used by the following functions (not taking error msg into account):\n  1. `show_available`\n  2. `show_visit_github` \n  3. `show_version_ready`\n\nLet's find out how they're used:\n  1. is called inside `check_new_version_available`, which shouldn't display a toast if `get_new_github_version_info_async` return nothing.\n  2. is called by `try_autoupdate`, which again returns if `check_new_version_available` returned nothing.\n  3. is also called by try_autoupdate, same as above.\n\nWe'd expect many bug reports regarding false-positive update notifications if `get_new_github_version_info_async` worked incorrectly in the majority of cases, so it's either a subtle bug in that function, or the update notification was somehow snoozed and resurfaced later.\n\n`VersionHelper` could accept invalid input w/o indicating any error, thus leading to unitialized version fileds. Perhaps Github rarely doesn't send the tag, so we observe this issue.\n\nIf we still experience the issue, we'll need to ask a user which able to experience it to delete their `update_state.json` or use \"check for updates\" button, so we can reliably reproduce and debug it.\n\n\n## Validation Steps Performed\n\n- installed PT on a clean machine w/ and w/o `--skip_dotnet_install` flag\n- unit tests passed", "NaN"], ["6203", "[FancyZones] fix warning", "Enrico Giordani", "enricogior", "08/28/20, 09:30:04 AM", "## Summary of the Pull Request\n\nFix a **int -> size_t** warning", "NaN"], ["6210", "[PowerRename] fix build warning", "Enrico Giordani", "enricogior", "08/28/20, 12:45:25 PM", "\n\n## Summary of the Pull Request\n\nFix a build warning:\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3206696/91546830-5e184f00-e923-11ea-9ff8-a989b33d329b.png)\n\n## Info on Pull Request\n\nPowerRenameUWPUI uses the resources from powerrename\\dll\\Resources.resx, the fix removes the duplicated definitions\n\n## Validation Steps Performed\n\nBuild the `PowerRenameUWPUI` project and verify that the `PowerRenameUWPUI.exe`'s properties are set correctly\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3206696/91546968-8e5fed80-e923-11ea-992d-b4207708969c.png)", "NaN"], ["6212", "Fixed a stack overflow", "Ivan Sto\u0161i\u0107", "ivan100sic", "08/28/20, 11:55:00 AM", "## Summary of the Pull Request\n\nThis should fix issue #5856\nCredits to @gurnec for proposing the fix.\n\n## PR Checklist\n* [x] Applies to #5856\n* [x] CLA signed.

Accessible names have been added to the key remapping list and shortcut remapping lists.\n2. Accessible names have been added to the individual list items as well. Without these two changes the name was set to the item source which was Microsoft.Settings.UI.Lib.KeysDataModel etc, this was causing a property related issue. The screen reader was also reading out this (Microsoft.Settings.UI.Lib.KeysDataModel) value on navigating to the list. These issues have been fixed now.\n3. The arrow icons were not being read out previously. If we had the following remapping `A -> B`, A and B were being read out but not the arrow. Now it has been modified such that it is read out as `A **remapped to** B`. \n4. Similarly for shortcut remappings, `Ctrl B -> Ctrl C -> All Apps`, it was previously reading out only the keys, now it reads out ` Ctrl B **remapped to** Ctrl C **for target application** All apps`.\n5. The image on the right was previously being read as image or graphic based on the screen reader.

This results in `powerlauncher.exe` and settings window's `PowerToys Run` page crashing every time. This issue can not be resolved by reinstalling powertoys, since settings file persist across installations.  The error can only be mitigated by resetting the file to it's original format.\nThis following changes have been made in thia PR:\n1. This PR tries to mitigate deserialization issue by handling the error and retrying file read for a `MaxRetries` number of times at an interval of 1 sec. If this fails, the the settings is rewritten with default values and a non-blocking messagebox is displayed. \n2. Logging has been improved.\n\n## Validation Steps Performed\nManually validated that message box pops up if file is corrupted and `settings.json` is written with default settings. Follow the steps below to validate : \n1. Download corrupt `settings.json` from [here](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/files/5030022/Settings.JSON.zip) which was shared in PR #5558\n2. Replace `settings.json` at `%userprofile%/appdata/local/microsoft/powertoys/powertoys run/` with corrupt file, either at runtime or when pt run is disabled.\n\n![6295](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10995909/92061097-476e5f80-ed4a-11ea-8c48-035d7c90da37.png)", "NaN"], ["6299", "[Settings] Changed ImageSize class to parse as double instead of int", "Arjun Balgovind", "arjunbalgovind", "09/03/20, 08:43:55 PM", "## Summary of the Pull Request\n\n_What is this about?_\nThis PR fixes an issue where decimal values were not accepted for Image sizes.

This caused the plugin name to always remain \"Windows Indexer\" and the settings changes weren't being reflected in PT Run because of different names.\n* This PR unifies the name of the plugin in all places to `Windows Indexer`to make it similar to the other plugins which do not have the plugin keyword.\n\n## Validation Steps Performed\n\n_How does someone test & validate?_\n\n* Manually validated that the changes in settings reflect in PT Run", "NaN"], ["6549", "[FancyZones] Do not zone window if it merges with other window", "Stefan Markovic", "stefansjfw", "09/11/20, 10:35:44 AM", "e.g. merge Chrome tab into other Chrome window\n\n## Summary of the Pull Request\n\n_What is this about?_\nIf some of the window properties changed while drag&drop (durring MoveSize* FZ methods), that means that window is merged with other window or changed in some other way.

Issue number where discussion took place: #xxx\n\n## Info on Pull Request\n\n_What does this include?_\n\nThe general settings.json file on being accessed by settings was throwing a file in use IOException because it was being used by another process. \n\nThe way settings and runner worked before this PR is as follows: the settings on start-up checks if the general settings.json file exists and reads from it, if not it creates a new one. The runner on the other hand during start-up does not save to the file (`apply_general_settings` is passed with a false save argument). There is no contention during this part.\n\nHowever, the issue occurs when settings tries to open the general settings.json file everytime it needs information in any viewmodel or converter. When any change is made in the settings, that information is communicated to the runner and it is the runner's responsibility to write to the settings.json file. However, since we have one process continuously trying to read from a file and the other writing to the same file, there is contention.\n\nTo fix this issue, the following changes have been made -\n* Rather than adding a retry-block everywhere the settings is being accessed, the need to open the file each time has been removed by making the generalViewModel's `GeneralSettingsConfig` a public static variable.\n* The shell page of settings (which is the base page) loads the general page on start-up.\n```\npublic ShellPage()\n        {\n            InitializeComponent();\n\n            DataContext = ViewModel;\n            ShellHandler = this;\n            ViewModel.Initialize(shellFrame, navigationView, KeyboardAccelerators);\n            shellFrame.Navigate(typeof(GeneralPage));\n        }\n```\n* Therefore, the general page is the first one to be loaded on start-up and the GeneralSettingsConfig variable is set in it's constructor. The generalViewModel tries to open the settings.json file and loads the information from it if it exists, if not it creates a new settings.json file. Hence, this variable is always initialized when settings is running. This is also the only time the settings.json file is accessed by the settings process (and as mentioned above on start-up runner does not write to the file so there is no contention). From now on any changes are directly accessed by using the `GeneralSettingsConfig` in the settings process and passed to the runner which is now the only process accessing that file. \n\nMight possibly be related to #6527 as well (even this is a IOException in the settings hotkeycontrol).\n\n## Validation Steps Performed\n\n_How does someone test & validate?_\n\n* All tests pass (the format had to be changed for initializing generalSettings based on the code changes).\n* Manually validated in release as well as in debug mode that the crash no longer occurs.\n* Also validated that the converters work as expected by changing the theme.\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28739210/93115579-e5c6c300-f670-11ea-85e1-c37e30464a09.png)", "NaN"], ["6626", "[Settings] Fix settings process not terminating on closing settings while minimized", "Arjun Balgovind", "arjunbalgovind", "09/16/20, 04:47:44 PM", "## Summary of the Pull Request\n\n_What is this about?_\nThis PR fixes the issue where Settings process doesn't get terminated when it is closed while minimized. This was happening because of the xaml island hiding code that we added in which sets the CoreWindow to hidden. It seems like when this window handle is hidden it does not receive the destroy window message, and hence the process never terminates because this thread is still active. \n\nThe fix in this PR involves checking if the window is minimized in the MainWindow_Closing handler, and if so it calls Environment.Exit on a separate task (because running it on the UI thread seemed to have noticeable performance impact).\n\nThe other alternate fix was to set the CoreWindow back to visible. This has the negative effect that the xaml island icon appears briefly when the process is closed (for the minimized closing scenario), so the Environment.Exit fix was preferred over this.\n\n\n\n## PR Checklist\n* [X] Applies to #4430 \n* [X] CLA signed.

With the changes in this PR, for Key to Shortcut remappings when they are loaded in on opening the KBM window or when the shortcut is adding from the Type button, the MapToSameKey error will be ignored.\n\n## PR Checklist\n* [X] Applies to #6695 \n* [X] CLA signed. If not, go over [here](https://cla.opensource.microsoft.com/microsoft/PowerToys) and sign the CLA\n* [X] Tests passed\n\n## Info on Pull Request\n\n_What does this include?_\n- The crash in #6695 was occurring because of the key to shortcut remapping Shift(left) -> Shift(left) + [. \n- The `AddShortcutToControl` method (which is called while loading existing remappings while starting the remap windows, or from the handler of Type button), adds in the keys sequentially as if a person was entering them (so that the logic for using Type and entering by dropdowns is the same). The issue with this in the above example is that there is an intermediate state of Shift(left) -> Shift(left), which results in a MapToSameKey error.\n- With the changes in this PR, when AddShortcutToControl is added and the shortcut is atleast two keys (atleast one modifier), then the MapToSameKey error is ignored for the first execution of the ValidateShortcutSelection handler, after which that state is reset\n- Earlier for a user to enter such a mapping, the only way was to do something like Shift -> Ctrl+ [ and then replace Ctrl with Shift. Now a user can directly type Shift+[ from the Type button. The behavior of using the drop down to put Shift first will still lead to a warning since we don't have any way of knowing whether the user will complete it as a shortcut or a key to key mapping.\n\n**Note:** The alternate approach to fixing this was to get rid of the `MapToSameKey` error and instead this error check would be done only on clicking the OK button, and if such a mapping is found it would show the warning \"Some remappings could not be applied do you want to continue\". The downside of this is a user may have added several remappings like `A`->`A`, `Ctrl`->`Ctrl` etc but they get to know that these are invalid only after pressing OK so it could have a worse UI experience.\nTo clarify in terms of logic, mapping Shift->Shift is invalid (since it doesnt make sense since you are mapping a key to itself), but Shift->Shift+A is completely valid (if a user wants to orphan their Shift key to use a Shift based shortcut that is fine)\n\n## Validation Steps Performed\n\n_How does someone test & validate?_\n- Add Shift(left)->Shift(left) + A shortcut from Type button in the remap key window and save settings\n- Reopen Remap key and validate no crash occurs\n- Try adding Shift(left) -> Shift(left) +A by drop down and validate that when you enter Shift it shows Remap to same key error.

This is to keep the UI organized and well-spaced when the window is made smaller (otherwise the arrow icons would touch the adjacent controls). Width values were determined by trial and error.\n- Horizontal scrolling has been enabled on the scrollviewers\n- Both scrollbars' visibility are set to Auto so that they appear only if content is not visible\n- Moved the example and header text out of the scroll viewer in both windows. This was done because of the following reasons:\n    - Even though the textwrap property is set on these TextBlocks, if the MaxWidth is not constrained these will occupy all the area. The side effect of this on the ScrollViewer was that the scroll viewer would always be visible even at the default window size since the scrollViewer fits the content such that the text is not wrapped\n    - By moving this text out of the scroll viewer, it makes a behavior change to scrolling such that even if the user scrolls down, the example and window headers will still be visible. This allows users to refer to the example even if they are several rows down. This also makes the UI closer to how a ListView would behave w.r.t scrolling\n\n## Validation Steps Performed\n\n_How does someone test & validate?_\n- Resize window height and width to larger and smaller than default and validate that all controls can be seen by scrolling vertically/horizontally\n- Add many remappings and validate scrolling", "NaN"], ["6757", "FxCop and StyleCop for SVG thumbnail", "Clint Rutkas", "crutkas", "09/22/20, 02:44:13 AM", "## Summary of the Pull Request\n\nInstalls and icons change / render.

For KBM to work consistently with RDP, that setting needs to be toggled off otherwise hooks get blocked\n\n## PR Checklist\n* [X] Applies to #6792 \n* [X] CLA signed. If not, go over [here](https://cla.opensource.microsoft.com/microsoft/PowerToys) and sign the CLA\n* [X] Tests passed\n\n## Info on Pull Request\n\n_What does this include?_\n- As seen in the screenshot below, the crash occurred because of a mutex re-entry.\n![KBM crash mutex](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32061677/94085904-3f8c6300-fdbe-11ea-9692-442d31e10ecc.png)\n- When remote desktop sends back the keyboard input to the local machine for getting processed by the hook, the `dwExtraInfo` parameter is always reset to a large value (probably used by RDP's hook logic). This causes the above crash because for a Caps Lock to Ctrl (and vice versa) when we press Ctrl we reset the state of Ctrl by sending Ctrl key up with a suppress flag (flags are recorded in dwExtraInfo) so that it can be suppressed at the start of our hook. Because of RDP resetting the dwExtraInfo flag, when it is received by KBM we no longer have that info and we do not suppress it. Because of this we end up re-entering the Single key remap method and it's mutex\n- The fix only prevents the crash, however since RDP prevents key injection when this option is set to the remote computer or full screen scenario, the remappings will not actually apply.\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32061677/94087209-0eae2d00-fdc2-11ea-9cb7-ca334d89c4d0.png)\n- Currently the only reason for having the mutex was that when a user presses the OK button from Remap Keys/Shortcuts the remapping tables get reset and modified, which could lead to concurrency issues as that happens on the UI thread while the keyboard hook which runs on the main runner thread could also access it at the same time.\n**- To solve the issues above the options were to manually lock/unlock before every SendInput (not a clean solution) or change to recursive mutex (performance overhead, and perf is important when it comes to remapping), or wrap all the parts of code which access the remapping tables in thread safe methods. While the last option was ideal, and it straightforward for single key remaps, for shortcut remaps this adds more memory usage and perf hits since the shortcut remaps read from the table and write back to it (to store if the shortcut has been invoked), which in turn requires getting read only copies of the entire table and locking the mutex several times more.\n- To avoid the above issues, the code has been changed to use an atomic bool variable which stores whether the remappings have been disabled.\n     - Whenever the UI thread modifies the the tables, before modifying we set this variable to false and after its done we set it back to true.\n     - On the hook side we check this variable at the start of each hook operation and proceed only if this value is true.\n     - Thus if a key is pressed while the tables are being modified the remap logic in the hook gets skipped (which is fine since we won't be blocking the key input as was happening before with the mutex and we won't be suppressing it so keys will work normally till the operation completes).\n    - Since the variable is atomic, accesses to it are thread safe\n    - The only other case which could be potentially harmful is if the tables are modified while the remapping is in the middle of execution (unlikely since hook operations are fast but still theoretically possible). As per [this stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15067160/stdmap-thread-safety) this shouldn't be an issue in practice. In our scenario this is actually impossible since we have a flag which ensures when the Remap keys window is open all remappings are disabled, and when the Remap shortcuts window is open all shortcut remappings are disabled. If the shortcut remapper is in execution it won't be possible to launch the UI mid execution since the call to launch the UI is on the runner thread so it would occur after the hook.\n    - Added several aliases for complex types to clean up the code\n    - Commented out all definitions for the single key toggle to modifier logic since the feature is not used and is an artifact of the proof of concept code.**\n\n\n## Validation Steps Performed\n\n_How does someone test & validate?_\n- Validate that key/shortcut remappings work normally\n- Validate that the crash in #6792 doesn't occur. Repro steps are as follows:\n    - Launch KBM in a local machine with remappings Caps->Ctrl(left) and Ctrl(left)->Caps\n    - Open RDP with this setting either on `remote computer` or the `fullscreen` option with RDP in full screen\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32061677/94087306-42895280-fdc2-11ea-9da8-f0887e600f65.png)\n\n    - Press Ctrl(left).

(Apps are created and written to in chunks, leading to a lot of events being triggered before the installation process is over). There is no way to tell that the installation process is complete, other than to wait for the last event (again which we have no idea that it is the last event).\n\nTo improve the handling of such cases, instead of immediately acting on getting an event, we instead put it in a queue. The background task keeps dequeueing the elements at regular intervals of 5 seconds. Once it dequeues an element, it waits for 0.5 a second to allow the addition of any more events to the queue. This way, after we reach the last event for a particular file, we wait for 5 more seconds before trying to get a handle on the app. \n\nAlso added a line of code to release unmanaged memory.\n\n## Validation Steps Performed\n\n_How does someone test & validate?_\n\n* Installed calibre numerous times and validated that it installs as expected.\n* Also installed some epic games and validated that they install.\n* Added unit tests for the dequeue logic.", "NaN"], ["6832", "Changed default theme in settings to be consistent with that of shortcut guide", "Alekhya ", "alekhyareddy28", "09/28/20, 07:44:19 PM", "## Summary of the Pull Request\n\n_What is this about?_\n\nWhen the settings.json file of shortcut guide does not exist, the runner starts shortcut guide with it's default configurations (ie. the ones present in shortcut_guide.cpp and shortcut_guide.h so it has it's background theme set to system).

If not, go over [here](https://cla.opensource.microsoft.com/microsoft/PowerToys) and sign the CLA\n* [X] Tests added/passed\n\n## Info on Pull Request\n\n_What does this include?_\nModule changes:\n- The existing code for enabling/disabling involves removing/adding the registry key which is added during installation but it was set for HKCU reg instead of HKLM (in the installer it was changed to HKLM in a later release). Because of this enabling/disabling could add/remove some unused registry entries. This has been changed to HKLM to avoid any errors in the future if the code is uncommented.\n- For Thumbnail providers the registry modification steps were incorrect, so they have been changed accordingly to read/write `HKCR/fileExtension/{E357FCCD-A995-4576-B01F-234630154E96}` with value as the CLSID of the provider\n- To allow the `FileExplorerPreviewSettings` code to be more usable for future modules, `FileExplorerPreviewSettings` was made into an interface with most methods implemented except the registry related methods. `PreviewHandlerSettings` and `ThumbnailProviderSettings` classes were added which implemented the above interfaces. This separation was made since the registry paths and logic differed between the two. With this change the two variables for storing the preview handlers and thumbnail providers in `powerpreview` were combined.\n- Removed unnecessary arguments in registry wrapper\n- A `CheckRegistryState` method was added to the interface which is used to check if the registry key (for enabling/disabling that module) is already present with the correct values or not\n- `UpdateState` method in the interface was modified such that it takes elevation state as argument. After updating the toggle state and checking if the File Explorer PowerToy is enabled it checks if the registry state already matches the new state. If it doesn't it makes the necessary update if PT is elevated or returns a failure if it is not elevated.\n- In `set_config` in `powerpreview` when a setting changes UpdateState is called on all the modules, and if any of them return a failure, a warning message is shown to the user indicating the user would have to restart PT as admin for settings to take effect. (This code path would generally not occur in New settings, it could occur in old settings though).\n- In `powerpreview`, a wrapper was added which first checks if the registry state of all the modules matches the toggle state, and if it doesn't it performs a method if elevation or shows the warning if not elevated.\n- The wrapper is used in enable(), so that modules which are enabled as per the toggle setting should be enabled in registry. Since enable gets called when PT is started, if there is a mismatch between the settings if PT is not elevated it will throw a warning, and if it is elevated it will update the registry for all these modules.\n- An elevation only check wrapper is also used in disable(), so that modules get disabled in registry only if elevated. Since disable gets called when PT is started, if PT is not elevated it will throw a warning, and if it is elevated it will update the registry for all these modules.\n- Regarding the above 2 points, the enable/disable setting is not exposed in New settings but it is in old settings. This could cause issues if a user upgrades from old to new settings via Windows update and previously disabled File Explorer as they can never re-enable it.\n\nUI Changes:\n- The settings format for File Explorer was invalid (on C# side) and would get ignored by Runner as it had `Properties` instead of `properties`, that has been fixed.\n- Since the registry can be modified only if PT is run as admin, additional text has been added to warn the user that the settings can be modified only if run as admin. This is visible only if PT is unelevated\n- When PT is unelevated the toggles and text for these settings are disabled\n- An additional textblock has been added for thumbnail provider toggles to indicate a reboot might be required for changes to take effect.\n- For checking elevation the  ViewModel has been modified to include the general settings as well (as done in some other settings modules). The IsElevated value of the general settings config is used. Tests have been refactored accordingly to include the extra argument\n\n\n## Tests\n- Updated existing PowerPreview SetRegistryValue tests to check RegistryValue as well\n- Split UpdateState tests to include Elevation status and PreviewHandler vs ThumbnailProvider differences\n- Split Enable/Disable tests for PreviewHandler and ThumbnailProvider to check correct registry details\n\n## Feedback required\n- Text on the warning dialogs and the Settings page\n- Unused \"enable\" setting for File Explorer. The \"enable\" value for File Explorer in the general settings file was used in old settings as there was an external toggle and separate toggles for each handler, but there is no toggle in new settings, so there is no way to modify that value. If a user was using old settings (i.e. old Windows version) and had File Explorer disabled, when they move the new settings by Windows update, the setting will still be disabled but it cannot be changed from PT Settings, and the user has to manually modify the json. Should we deprecate that or add another toggle which results in all the handlers getting disabled? (the equivalent of the Enable toggles for a powertoy as a whole).\n- Modifying registry when running PT from VS (and PT isn't installed), could lead to bad registry. This could affect devs\n\n## Validation Steps Performed\n\n_How does someone test & validate?_\n- Build and install MSI\n- Before running PT, validate that .md/.svg preview handlers are working and svg thumbnails are working\n- Check your general settings json file and File Explorer settings file. Based on the values you should see one of the scenarios (similarly when PowerToys isn't running you can modify the file to one of the scenarios below to check if the expected behavior occurs). Run PowerToys elevated/unelevated and check the corresponding row. The expected behavior below assumes that all 3 modules are enabled in the registry (as would occur in a fresh install). If File Explorer is enabled in general settings, for any other registry state basically if the json and registry states don't match, in case of unelevated PowerToys it will throw a warning, and if it is elevated it will make the changes as per json. If File Explorer is not enabled, all of them will always be disabled. \n\n| File Explorer in General Settings | File Explorer Settings (svg-ph, svg-tp, md-ph) | Elevation | Behavior                                                  |\n|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Enabled                           | All enabled                                    | False     | No warning and all 3 work                                 |\n| Enabled                           | All enabled                                    | True      | No warning and all 3 work                                 |\n| Disabled                          | Any combination                                | False     | Warning and all 3 work                                    |\n| Disabled                          | Any combination                                | True      | No warning and all 3 disabled                             |\n| Enabled                           | At least one disabled                          | False     | Warning and all 3 work                                    |\n| Enabled                           | At least one disabled                          | True      | No warning, and only the ones which are enabled will work |\n    ", "NaN"], ["6894", "[FancyZones] Remove WindowMoveHander pImpl pattern", "Stefan Markovic", "stefansjfw", "09/30/20, 07:19:21 AM", "Introduces runtime overhead and makes debugging unnecessarily more painful\n\n## PR Checklist\n* [x] Applies to https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/issues/6895\n* [x] CLA signed.

When we click the OK/Cancel button, this gets executed on the UI(dispatcher) thread, but when executed from the KeyDelay object this was getting called from the Delay thread. This causes re-entrancy on the queueMutex as it already has a lock on the mutex when it calls any of the shortPress, longPress or longPressRelease handlers, leading to a crash.\n- Even if we remove the mutex usage in the destructor, it would result in a deadlock because the delay thread would wait on the delay thread `join` call. If we remove the `join` call we would run into other issues since the object deletion is occurring mid-execution of the method.\n- In 0.21 separate threads were being created for this, which could lead to difficult to catch crashes due to multithreaded delete statements without locks, and the reason for using separate threads wasn't documented.\n- To fix the issues mentioned above, the code was modified such that it runs on the UI thread in all cases.

If not, go over [here](https://cla.opensource.microsoft.com/microsoft/PowerToys) and sign the CLA\n\n## Info on Pull Request\n\n_What does this include?_\n- The localization step where build-localization.cmd is executed has been moved to occur before the PowerToys solution is built on the build farm. This is done because we have to generate the resx/resw files before building PowerToys.\n- For C++ projects we do not need to update the installer as the logic for converting resx to rc file adds in the code for checking the current language. In case of C++ dlls/executables all the resources are within the same dll/exe, and separate resource dlls are not generated\n- For .NET Core C# projects, the csproj files did not have to be updated, as .NET Core projects automatically pick up any files under the `Properties` subdirectory by default even after the project has finished loading\n- For .NET Framework C# projects, the csproj files had to be updated to pick up any resx files in the Properties directory as they don't do this by default. For these to load locally, you have to unload and reload the project or close/re-open the solution.\n- For both .NET Core and .NET Framework projects, language folders are created in the output folder, and all of them contain files in the format `ProjectName.resources.dll`.\n- For UWP projects, the project needs to get the resw files in the file path as `Strings\\4-letter-language-code\\Resources.resw` in order to know the correct language culture. Since the pipeline adds the files in the path `Strings\\en-us\\Resources.2-letter-language-code.resw`, a PowerShell script was added to move these files to the correct path, and the csproj was updated to include all files in the path `Strings\\*\\Resources.resw`. Since this needs to be executed only on the pipeline, this script is run at the end of build-localization.cmd rather than using a pre-build event on the Settings project to prevent it from affecting local builds. In case of UWP projects, resources.dll files are not created, instead all the resources are added to the `resources.pri` file (which is already present in the installer). The pri format is a binary format, however using the command `MakePRI dump /if resources.pri` in VS Developer Command Prompt (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/apps/jj552945(v=win.10)?redirectedfrom=MSDN), it is possible to obtain an xml version of the resources and inspect the values. It contains all the resources for each language along with many resources required by all UWP apps by default for error message in every language.\n- To re-use as much code as possible in the wix installer, foreach loops and lists were used, such that in the first loop we create the Directory for each language code in each of the localized projects. After that loop, we define the components for each localized project for each language (a loop could not be added for each project as Wix does not support iterating two lists in parallel, since in this case we would need a tuple of several variables to include the correct file path and the correct Directory name).\n- To prevent this code from executing on local MSI builds, we check if variable `IsPipeline` is defined, and add these components only if they are present. `IsPipeline` is defined in the `build-installer.cmd` file before the installer project is built at https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/blob/bee1af427bfde5198c3978aef7fab448d7cef5ab/.pipelines/build-installer.cmd#L4. This ensures that the localized resources are added only if build-installer.cmd is used to build the solution (which is only used on the CDPX pipeline)\n- Updated the build output to include all resources.dll files for signing in the pipeline\n- Deleted old ImageResizer localized resx files.\n\n## Validation Steps Performed\n\n_How does someone test & validate?_\n- Validated that PowerToysSetup builds successfully locally without any localized resource files\n- Validated PowerToys builds on the CDPX pipeline\nUsing the MSI from the CDPX pipeline (https://github-private.visualstudio.com/microsoft/_build/results?buildId=13062&view=results, shared on mail):\n- Validated PowerLauncher.exe localized strings are loaded (the automation property strings have already been translated so verified it by using Narrator in French).\n- C++ projects don't need any installer changes, validated with MSI that KBM strings are loaded in French\n- Validated that FZ Editor localized strings are loaded in French\n- Validated PowerToys Settings (UWP) strings are loaded in French\n\n## Screenshots of French PowerToys\nSince all the strings have not yet been translated, I wasn't able to get any screenshots with translated strings for the preview handlers or for the context menu Image Resizer or PowerRename.\n**Disclaimer**: I don't know French so I cannot validate if these are actually correct, but I know that they aren't English\n![fzeditor](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32061677/95143362-b4e72480-072a-11eb-9833-a912bf10198b.png)\n![image resizer ui](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32061677/95143363-b6185180-072a-11eb-96f0-b411c8f1ce10.png)\n![kbm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32061677/95143364-b6185180-072a-11eb-8672-8f332b6918ac.png)\n![launcher](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32061677/95143365-b6185180-072a-11eb-89fe-da10d2f9b04a.png)\n![powerrename](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32061677/95143366-b6b0e800-072a-11eb-9177-be323b86dc2b.png)\n![Settings](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32061677/95143368-b6b0e800-072a-11eb-8e47-61982d192088.png)\n![SG](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32061677/95143369-b6b0e800-072a-11eb-9192-6198a93c0a03.png)", "NaN"], ["6987", "[fxcop] Settings UI unit tests", "Luthfi Mawarid", "lmawarid", "10/06/20, 10:00:26 PM", "## Summary of the Pull Request\n\nAdding FxCop to the Microsoft.PowerToys.Settings.UI.UnitTests.csproj project, and fixing the resulting warnings and errors. \n\n## PR Checklist\n* [x] Applies to #5129 \n* [ ] CLA signed.

The following cases have been handled -\n1. When shift was never pressed while entering or within the control and tab was pressed, in this case simply ignore the tab key press.\n2. When shift was pressed while entering but it was released in between then the system still thinks that the shift key is pressed, therefore simulate a shift key up event and ignore the tab that was pressed, therefore simulating a tab key press.\n3. When shift was pressed while entering and remained pressed while leaving, simply ignoring the tab key press will suffice as the system already knows that shift is pressed.\n4. When shift was not pressed while entering but shift was pressed within the control, as the system does not know that the shift key was pressed, send a shift key down event and ignore the tab key press to simulate shift+tab.\n\nA couple of other things that had to be kept in mind - \n* If the shift key press was used only to get focus out of the control, then reset the shift status within the control to not being pressed.\n* Send inputs with the extra info flag, with the same value as that used within the keyboard hook so as to ignore any key event that was sent with that information. This was the hook does not end up consuming it's own inputs.\n\n* The lastValidSettings is not always valid and therefore another variable was added called latestsettings. The code was modified so that both the variables now perform as the name suggests.

Example: Ctrl+A->Disable, press Ctrl+A, release A and press B, system gets Ctrl+A+B rather than just Ctrl+B.\nThe PR also adds dummy key events where its required and removes them where unnecessary to fix Start Menu accidentally opening cases.\n\n## PR Checklist\n* [x] Applies to #7165 \n* [x] CLA signed. If not, go over [here](https://cla.opensource.microsoft.com/microsoft/PowerToys) and sign the CLA\n* [x] Tests added/passed\n\n## Info on Pull Request\n\n_What does this include?_\n- For single key to shortcut remaps\n    - Removed dummy key event usage, since there were was no actual scenario where it would be required as we would never end up in a state where a modifier like Win key is pressed and release without any keys in between. Added comments to explain why\n- For shortcut disable\n    - Added a bool flag isOriginalActionKeyPressed to the RemapShortcut class. This keeps track of whether the action key is physically being pressed by the user or not for remap to disable cases. This is required specifically for remaps to disable because we can't use GetAsyncKeyState to find out if the action key is pressed as there would be none of the original keys pressed detected by the OS and no target keys either (as its Disable). For s2s and s2k we get around this by checking the state of the target action key (for s2s) and the target key (for s2k). We needed this with the latest changes as we fixed a scenario with disable where we send the original action key even if it wasn't pressed .\n    - The flag is set to true whenever the action key is pressed, and is set to false when the action key is released or when the remap is reset\n- For Shortcut to shortcut remap\n    - Added dummy key event for case where modifier is released after invoking remap\n- For shortcut to key remap\n    - Added dummy key event for case where modifier is released after invoking remap\n   - Changed the behavior when action key is released. Earlier we would directly reset the remap state and revert to physical keys at this point, which is different from what we do for s2s where we just release the corresponding target action key without reverting. This was done because s2k should be usable when pressed with other keys as well, but this logic was found to cause issues with opening start menu because of the large number of key messages that are sent each time the action key is released and pressed again. To fix this, the code was modified similar to s2s such that it just releases the target key without reverting to physical but this is done only if no other keys are pressed along with it (which we check using isKeyboardStateClear from the Shortcut class, by making a temp shortcut with the target key). If other keys are pressed we revert back to the original state. Examples of this are Ctrl+A->Win and you press Ctrl+A, release A and press A again. This case would have a perf improvement as well as fixes Start menu issue. If use presses B+Ctrl+A or Ctrl+A+B and releases A, we should reset back to B+Ctrl/Ctrl+B since that could by used to execute some other action with some other keys\n    - Added the ResetModifiers For CapsLock IME issue function call in the modifier key down cases after the shortcut is invoked\n    - Modified the case where any other key press is obtained while the shortcut is invoked such that we check if the original action key is physically pressed, and if it is we don't suppress the new key (allowing Ctrl+A->Win, to work with Ctrl+A+B), and if it is we revert the keyboard state back to original (since in the previous example the system should see Ctrl+B pressed)\n- Updated comments on all dummy key event usage with an example for why it is required\n- Removed unnecessary assignments of isShortcutInvoked to true. It is now set to true only on initial invoke, and set to false whenever we \"finish\" shortcut remap execution.\n\n## Tests\n- Added comments before each section of tests so that it is easy to categorize s2s, s2k, etc tests.\n- Adjusted existing tests to behave as per the new changes such as the Disable fix and the action key release behavior for s2k.\n- Tweaked asserts in some tests to also check isShortcutInvoked\n- s2k: Added tests for the behavior of releasing action key when other keys are pressed or action key is released and then other keys are pressed\n- s2k: Added tests for the two Caps Lock IME scenarios that were added\n- Added tests for disable for releasing action key with other keys pressed\n- Added tests for disable to check if isOriginalActionKeyPressed is updated correctly\n- Added tests for all 5 dummy key event scenarios so that each case has a test example to avoid it breaking in the future\n## Validation Steps Performed\n\n_How does someone test & validate?_\n- Tests pass\n\n**Remap Keys Window**\n- Validate key to shortcut remappings (minimal changes in this space, no behavior change) \n    - Remap Win->Ctrl+V and validate that start menu never opens accidentally on pressing/releasing Win\n    - Remap S->Win+A and validate that start menu never opens accidentally on pressing/releasing S\n\n**Remap Shortcuts Window**\nClear the above remappings and proceed\n- Validate shortcut to key remappings\n    - Remap Ctrl+D->Win.

Following the refactoring of the calculator plugin, the searched which resulted in 0 as the result were not working as there was no difference between a default result returned when the input was not valid and a valid input resulting in 0 as the answer. \nThe `ValidResult` field has been added to distinguish a valid result from a default result. null couldn't be returned because CalculateResult is a non-nullable type.\nEg: 1-1.\n2. Exceptions were being thrown when the user query is not complete, as the queryhelper thinks that the query is valid but the interpreter doesn't. \nEg: sin, 1+2+\n3. When a string corresponding to a function is the user query an exception is thrown because it is not a valid interpreter input.\nEg: Say hypothetically we're seraching for some app named logo, then on entering `log` the calculator plugin would be invoked as there is a match with the regex, however, it is not a valid input to the interpreter.\n4. There were some functions such as bin2dec, hex2dec, eigval, etc which are not valid inputs to the mages.interpreter function. hence it has been removed. Otherwise, the calculator helper would think that these inputs are valid as they match the regex but the mages.interpreter function would throw an exception as they are not valid mathematical oparations according to it.\n\nThe ideal way to capture a valid input would be using a BNF for a mathematical operation but that cannot be captured in a regex. \n\n## Validation Steps Performed\n\n_How does someone test & validate?_\n\nAdded tests.\nManually validated it", "NaN"], ["7455", "Remove unused pinyin code", "Divyansh", "somil55", "10/23/20, 05:34:26 PM", "## Summary of the Pull Request\nRemove unused pinyin files inherited from Wox.\n\n## PR Checklist\n* [x] Applies to #7220 \n* [x] CLA signed.

This PR should hopefully fulfill these users' needs. For the discussion, see issue #1167 \n\n**What is include in the PR:** \n\nA modification of a single function. With this change, if there are multiple overlapping zones covering the point above which the user is hovering, one of the zones will be selected based on the position inside the overlapped area, allowing the user to drop the window into the desired zone.\n\n**How does someone test / validate:** \n\nCheck the discussion in #1167.

This PR fixes the issue.\n\n**What is this about:**\n\nThe issue is not with the centralized keyboard hook as initially suspected, but with the member `m_enabled` being set to `true` even when PT Run isn't actually enabled, thus causing the hook to accept the shortuct.\n\n**What is include in the PR:** \n\nSet `m_enabled = true` only when PT Run is actually started.\n\n**How does someone test / validate:** \n\nFirst, make sure that PT Run is enabled in the settings and the shortcut is set to some value e.g. Alt+Space.

This should probably just round (e.g. to '4,318').\n- [x] Culture dependent input should work (use of ',' or '.').\n- [ ] ~~Support multiple length input such as '1 foot 5 inch in cm'. (?)~~\n- [x] Support 'copy to clipboard' translations.\n- [x] Change to use the keywords 'to' and 'in' (if it's even possible to use multiple keywords, find out).\n\n## Quality Checklist\n\n- [x] **Linked issue:** As stated, I didn't open an issue before doing work (I know, very naughty) but it seems like there's an issue for it now: #9577 \n- [x] **Communication:** I've discussed this with core contributors in the issue. \n- [x] **Tests:** Added/updated and all pass\n- [x] **Installer:** Added/updated and all pass\n- [x] **Localization:** All end user facing strings can be localized\n- [x] **Docs:** Added/ updated\n- [x] **Binaries:** Any new files are added to WXS / YML\n   - [ ] No new binaries\n   - [x] [YML for signing](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/blob/master/.pipelines/pipeline.user.windows.yml#L68) for new binaries\n   - [x] [WXS for installer](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/blob/master/installer/PowerToysSetup/Product.wxs) for new binaries\n\n## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)\nA CLA must be signed.

For the full list, see below.\nThe reason why this was all done in a single, large PR is that this work required rewriting a large part\nof the backend code which maintains the grid layout, so it's hard to do incrementally.\n\n**What is include in the PR:** \n\n* Do not allow new zone layouts to have zones smaller than a predefined amount - enough to display the zone index properly in the editor. Existing zone layouts which do not satisfy this requirement can still be edited, but there could be some visual glitches similar to the old editor.\n\n![minsize](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9358361/110372116-316d8e80-804e-11eb-9438-6a5af6f5d795.gif)\n\n* Resizers will now glide seamlessly across each other, and can also overlap.\n\n**Before:**\n![resizercrash](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20975774/107098551-c5f68e00-680f-11eb-9a0f-9ad0688f93db.gif)\n\n**After:**\n![gliding](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9358361/110371318-1b130300-804d-11eb-87fb-2b109ee6e381.gif)\n\n* Don't allow splitting a zone into smaller zones if one of the resulting zones are too small.\n* Show a visual cue (gray splitter) when the above would happen.\n\n![nosplit](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9358361/110371486-56adcd00-804d-11eb-98fd-869a4fbfb717.gif)\n\n* Splitters will now snap smoothly to zone borders, using the same magnetic snapping present in the canvas editor.\n\n![smoothsnap](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9358361/110371669-9674b480-804d-11eb-80ce-eb7ed8b9a51a.gif)\n\n* A new data representation simplifies code drastically.\n* Now, the zones always logically occupy the entire screen area, and the spacing is added only when the zones are rendered. This is what allows for overlapping borders.\n* FancyZonesLib code is tweaked to correspond to this new representation. There could be a small impact on how existing layouts are drawn, perhaps by a couple of pixels.\n\n**How does someone test / validate:** \n\nCheck all functionality of the grid editor (splitting zones, merging zones, resizing, adding many zones, canceling the edit).\n\nFor more stress testing:\nCreate a grid layout using the old version, create many small zones and set zone spacing to a large value, then open the layout in the new editor and try editing it. There could be some glitches but there should be no crashes.\n\nCheck whether the documentation for the editor should be updated.\n\n## Quality Checklist\n\n- [x] **Linked issue:** #9540 #9419 #5027\n- [x] **Communication:** I've discussed this with core contributors in the issue. \n- [ ] **Tests:** Added/updated and all pass\n- [ ] **Installer:** Added/updated and all pass\n- [ ] **Localization:** All end user facing strings can be localized\n- [ ] **Docs:** Added/ updated\n- [ ] **Binaries:** Any new files are added to WXS / YML\n   - [ ] No new binaries\n   - [ ] [YML for signing](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/blob/master/.pipelines/pipeline.user.windows.yml#L68) for new binaries\n   - [ ] [WXS for installer](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/blob/master/installer/PowerToysSetup/Product.wxs) for new binaries\n\n## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)\nA CLA must be signed.

PT Run can not be started because the system requires the `explorer.exe` to be elevated to start it. And if the `explorer.exe` is elevated PT Run starts elevated as well. So I think in this case PT Run inherits elevation from PT and there's nothing we can do because those structures are opaque. \n\nAlso, PT Run cannot be started when PT is run elevated from a user account (#11038). PT runs on behalf of an admin account and can not access `explorer.exe` process of a user account.\n\nWe fixed it by choosing different approach to start a process unelevated from the elevated one(https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20131118-00/?p=2643).\n\n**What is include in the PR:** \n- Delegate creating of PT Run process to the `explorer.exe`. Use old approach as fallback.\n- Remove PT Run process handle from the module interface as with the new approach we can not get it without inner process communication\n- Rewrite PT Run process main in order to handle possible race conditions. A race condition can happen when restarting PT as administrator and a new process is not created because the old one hasn't been destroyed yet\n\n**How does someone test / validate:** \nCompatibility tab:\n- Set `Run this program as an administrator` in the compatibility tab of the properties of the PowerToys.exe\n- Start PowerToys\n- Verify that PowerToys Run is working. That is check the presence of `PowerLauncher.exe` or press `Alt+Space`\n\nRunning on behalf of an admin account:\n- Login a user account\n- Launch PowerToys as an administrator(Should ask credentials of an administrator)\n- Verify that `PowerToys.exe` is elevated and runs under the admin account\n- Verify that `PowerLauncher.exe` is not elevated and runs under the user account\n\nPossible regressions.\nEnable PT Run in settings and ensure that the hotkey brings up PT Run:\n   - when PowerToys is running unelevated on start-up\n   - when PowerToys is running as admin on start-up\n   - when PowerToys is restarted as admin, by clicking the restart as admin button in settings\n   \nRace condition:\n   - Try to enable/disalbe PT Run at least ten times quickly\n   - Verify that PT Run is still working\n   - Restart PT as administrator\n   - Verify that PT Run is still working\n   - Try to enable/disalbe PT Run at least ten times quickly again\n   - Verify that PT Run is still working\n   \n## Quality Checklist\n\n- [X] **Linked issue:** #10400, #11723, #11038\n- [ ] **Communication:** I've discussed this with core contributors in the issue. \n- [ ] **Tests:** Added/updated and all pass\n- [ ] **Installer:** Added/updated and all pass\n- [ ] **Localization:** All end user facing strings can be localized\n- [ ] **Docs:** Added/ updated\n- [ ] **Binaries:** Any new files are added to WXS / YML\n   - [ ] No new binaries\n   - [ ] [YML for signing](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/blob/master/.pipelines/pipeline.user.windows.yml#L68) for new binaries\n   - [ ] [WXS for installer](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/blob/master/installer/PowerToysSetup/Product.wxs) for new binaries\n\n## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)\nA CLA must be signed.

It introduces some accessibility issues and is a sub-par UX.\n\nTherefore, this PR introduces a new ShortcutControl and KeyVisuals control that can be used to visualize shortcuts and allows users to set a new shortcut while providing a better UX. It provides a dialog that allows for setting the keys and contains validation (e.g. showing red keys if the key is not valid). It's also fully keyboard accessible.\n\nIssues that are resolved with this PR:\n#11895 - OOBE now displays actual shortcuts (loaded out of the module settings)\n#12965 - using MarkdownTextBlock in OOBE now\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9866362/131634419-f230c973-39bd-48f4-8e90-0f8855252405.png)\n\n#5188 - invalid shortcuts can now longer be set - the UI provides feedback that the shortcut is incorrect and the save button will be disabled.\n#11196 - the shortcut control will no longer get immediate focus.\n- Windows and up/down/left/right keys are now rendered as icons.\n\n![SettingsShortcut3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9866362/131688212-22088c82-a3a5-4d0e-8050-86326b34384c.gif)\n\nVisuals are now also updated for Keyboard Manager.\n\n**Known issues**\nIn dark theme, the dialog will be rendered in light theme.
