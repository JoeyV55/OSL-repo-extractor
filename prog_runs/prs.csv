804/23/14 09:23:03 PMAdrian DaerrPDF-file metadata: Privacy Filtering all metadata"This pull-request pertains to the addition of metadata to PDF files associated with entries, as triggered by the menu entry ""Write XMP metadata to PDFs"" in the ""Tools"" menu. XMP is an extremely interesting feature that allows tagging PDF files (amongst others) with automatically retrievable metadata in much the same way mp3-tags allow adding title/author/... information to mp3 music files. Actually JabRef exports the metadata not only to two XMP namespaces (Dublin Core and a custom JabRef namespace), but also to the PDF DocumentInformation Object.

Practically from the beginning of the XMP-writing capabilities of JabRef, Christopher Oezbek had added _privacy filtering_ for the XMP-tagging of PDF-files with data from the bibtex-record, meaning that the user could define a list of fields (in Preferences->XMP metadata) which should _not_ be exported to the PDF file.  Unfortunately, the filtering was incomplete: jabref exports the metadata in three different forms, only one of which was originally filtered. In 2013 filtering was extended to both XMP namespaces, but JabRef still exported _all_ fields into the PDF DocumentInfo object. The two present commits correct this problem. The first (b45316f) prevents private fields from being exported to the PDF DocumentInfo. The second one more agressively erases these fields even if they already exist in the PDF document. 

The deletion of existing fields might be debateable. It seems the right thing to do for fields clearly generated by JabRef (viz. those prefixed by ""jabref/""), but there are four fields which might be of other origin (Author,Title,Subject and Keywords). Making a systematic exception for these four fields, i.e. not erasing them even if they are privacy filtered, is a bad idea and violates the principle of least surprise. This is why the second commit makes no exception. Deactivating the erasure for the four generic fields could however easily be added as an option in the XMP export preferences if it is judged important. The current behaviour has the advantage of reliably correcting PDF files previously tagged with a buggy privacy filtering.

If these commits are pulled into the master branch and confirmed to work, the bug #869 on the sourceforge tracker: 
https://sourceforge.net/p/jabref/bugs/869/

Main changes are:
- Create a new target based on Oracle's appbundler to create a bundle compatible with newer JVMs. (not compatible with Apple's JVM).
- Move the older target to Jabref-legacy.app.
- Remove the old deprecated wrapper OSXAdapter, which does not work with Oracle's JVM.
- Create new wrapper based on com.apple.eawt (compatible with both JVMs).
- Improve the quit behaviour.
- Add support for the Fullscreen feature.

The code changes are compatible with both Oracle's JVMs and Apple legacy one, but the legacy bundle is currently broken as the code requires Java 1.7+. Tested with Apple's JVM (1.6.0_65) and Oracle's JVM (1.8.0_45)."05/31/15 06:32:48 PMFix double-click opening of files on MacMoving the registration of Apple events ensures that double-clicking on a file to open it works even if JabRef is not yet running. =||=  =||= NicosPavlovNicolas Pavillon05/31/15 04:14:09 AMMove registration of Apple events to fix document opening when application starts1

Why?
- splash screen on modern systems is shown only for a very short period of time as JabRef starts fast
- we should focus on making JabRef to start as fast as possible. A splash screen reduces the time to start the software as additional code needs to be executed. 
- for each new version (even for beta and dev versions), we have to check in a png with 200KB file size into the repository. This increases the amount of storage required for the git repository by 200KB for each version/dev-version.
- The splash screen interferes with using JabRef via the CLI. 
- It reduces code in JabRef. Hence, less code needs to be maintained.

This is a PR that is open for discussion. Please add any pros/cons as you see fit. "4 =||= simonharrerSimon Harrer08/05/15 12:15:37 PM"Removes splash screen

Why?
- splash screen on modern systems is shown only for a very short period of time as JabRef starts fast
- we should focus on making JabRef to start as fast as possible. A splash screen reduces the time to start the software as additional code needs to be executed. 
- for each new version (even for beta and dev versions), we have to check in a png with 200KB file size into the repository. This increases the amount of storage required for the git repository by 200KB for each version/dev-version.
- The splash screen interferes with using JabRef via the CLI. 
- It reduces code in JabRef. Hence, less code needs to be maintained.

1. The layout formatter feature is a bit hidden and it is unclear how many people really use this feature.
2. The feature is complex to use
3. Some of the formatters should be a) integrated as default auto formatters b) removed because they really don't make a lot of sense.
4. Most license problems are caused by these classes.
# List

> - **Authors** : this formatter provides formatting options for the author and editor fields; for detailed information, see below. It deprecates a range of dedicated formatters provided in versions of JabRef prior to 2.7.
> - **CreateBibORDFAuthors** : formats authors for according to the requirements of the Bibliographic Ontology (bibo).
> - **CreateDocBookAuthors** : formats the author field in DocBook style.
> - **CreateDocBookEditors** : formats the editor field in DocBook style.
> - **CurrentDate**: outputs the current date. With no argument, this formatter outputs the current date and time in the format ""yyyy.MM.dd hh:mm:ss z"" (date, time and time zone). By giving a different format string as argument, the date format can be customized. E.g. \format[CurrentDate]{yyyy.MM.dd} will give the date only, e.g. 2005.11.30.
> - Default : takes a single argument, which serves as a default value. If the string to format is non-empty, it is output without changes. If it is empty, the default value is output. For instance, \format[Default(unknown)]{\year} will output the entry's year if set, and ""unknown"" if no year is set.
> 
> **DOIStrip**: strips any prefixes from the DOI string.

Should be automatically integrated as sensible default!

> **DOICheck** : provides the full url for a DOI link.

DOICheck as name makes no sense. Rename at least to DOILink.

> - FileLink(filetype) : if no argument is given, this formatter outputs the first external file link encoded in the field. To work, the formatter must be supplied with the contents of the ""file"" field.
>   This formatter takes the name of an external file type as an optional argument, specified in parentheses after the formatter name. For instance, \format[FileLink(pdf)]{\file} specifies pdf as an argument. When an argument is given, the formatter selects the first file link of the specified type. In the example, the path to the first PDF link will be output.
> - FirstPage : returns the first page from the ""pages"" field, if set. For instance, if the pages field is set to ""345-360"" or ""345--360"", this formatter will return ""345"".
> - FormatChars : This formatter converts LaTeX character sequences their equicalent unicode characters and removes other LaTeX commands without handling them.
> - FormatPagesForHTML : replaces ""--"" with ""-"".
> - FormatPagesForXML : replaces ""--"" with an XML en-dash.
> - GetOpenOfficeType : returns the number used by the OpenOffice.org bibliography system (versions 1.x and 2.x) to denote the type of this entry.
> - HTMLChars : replaces TeX-specific special characters (e.g. {^a} or {\""{o}}) with their HTML representations, and translates LaTeX commands \emph, \textit, \textbf into HTML equivalents.
> - HTMLParagraphs : interprets two consecutive newlines (e.g. \n \n) as the beginning of a new paragraph and creates paragraph-html-tags accordingly.
> - IfPlural : outputs its first argument if the input field looks like an author list with two or more names, or its second argument otherwise. E.g. \format[IfPlural(Eds.,Ed.)]{\editor} will output ""Eds."" if there is more than one editor, and ""Ed."" if there is only one.
> - JournalAbbreviator : The given input text is abbreviated according to the journal abbreviation lists. If no abbreviation for input is found (e.g. not in list or already abbreviated), the input will be returned unmodified. For instance, when using \format[JournalAbbreviator]{\journal}, ""Physical Review - Letters"" gets ""Phys. Rev. Lett.""
> - LastPage : returns the last page from the ""pages"" field, if set. For instance, if the pages field is set to ""345-360"" or ""345--360"", this formatter will return ""360"".
> - NoSpaceBetweenAbbreviations : LayoutFormatter that removes the space between abbreviated First names. Example: J. R. R. Tolkien becomes J.R.R. Tolkien.
> - NotFoundFormatter : Formatter used to signal that a formatter hasn't been found. This can be used for graceful degradation if a layout uses an undefined format.
> - Number : outputs the 1-based sequence number of the current entry in the current export. This formatter can be used to make a numbered list of entries. The sequence number depends on the current entry's place in the current sort order, not on the number of calls to this formatter.
> 
> **RemoveBrackets** : removes all curly brackets ""{"" or ""}"".

This just removes **all** brackets without checking for escape sequences or such, e.g. {.

> **RemoveBracketsAddComma**: removes all curly brackets ""{"" or ""}"". The closing curly bracket is replaced by a comma.

I don't see any use case where I want to do this.
- RemoveLatexCommands : removes LaTeX commands like \em, \textbf, etc. If used together with HTMLChars or XMLChars, this formatter should be called last.

> **RemoveTilde**: replaces the tilde character used in LaTeX as a non-breakable space by a regular space. Useful in combination with the NameFormatter discussed in the next section.
> 
> **RemoveWhitespace**: removes all whitespace characters.

Where would this make any sense?

> - Replace(regexp,replacewith) : does a regular expression replacement. To use this formatter, a two-part argument must be given. The parts are separated by a comma. To indicate the comma character, use an escape sequence: \,   The first part is the regular expression to search for. Remember that any commma character must be preceded by a backslash, and consequently a literal backslash must be written as a pair of backslashes. A description of Java regular expressions can be found at:  http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html   The second part is the text to replace all matches with.
> 
> **RisAuthors** : to be documented.
> **RisKeywords** : to be documented.
> **RisMonth** : to be documented.

> - RTFChars : replaces TeX-specific special characters (e.g. {^a} or {\""{o}}) with their RTF representations, and translates LaTeX commands \emph, \textit, \textbf into RTF equivalents.
> - ToLowerCase : turns all characters into lower case.
> - ToUpperCase : turns all characters into upper case.
> - WrapContent : This formatter outputs the input value after adding a prefix and a postfix, as long as the input value is non-empty. If the input value is empty, an empty string is output (the prefix and postfix are not output in this case). The formatter requires an argument containing the prefix and postix separated by a comma. To include the comma character in either, use an escape sequence (\,).
> - WrapFileLinks : See below.
> - XMLChars : : replaces TeX-specific special
>       characters (e.g. {^a} or {\""{o}}) with their XML
>       representations.

14301/25/16 05:20:31 PMOliver KoppRefactor BibTeX file field"JabRef should be convenient for new users to use. When using the `file` field, the format for each file entry is `description:link:type`. Multiple values can be put in separated by `;`. At each file, fields can be omitted. `file = {desc}` is a valid enry. Naively, I would have assumed that `desc` is the link. Furthermore `type` is a custom JabRef string, but [Media Types](http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml) are the accepted standard for providing types.

Therefore, I propose the new format `link:description:media type`.

Furthermore, I propose dropping support for the legacy fields pdf and ps. These fields were [legacy from the end of 2007 on](https://sourceforge.net/p/jabref/mailman/message/1369285/). Even though some users want to keep the old fields, I would vote for an intuitive handling of references to external files instead of clutter the UI with legacy things. (I currently can't find the email in the mailinglist where we discussed that :()

## Discussion points

- Is media type too over-engineered? Can we drop the type completely and derive the type by the  file extension?
- Are `:` and `;` good separators?
- Is `file` really more intuitive than separate `pdf` and `ps` links? Should we keep the `pdf` field?
- Should the new field be called `attachments` to enable easy migration from the old format to the new one?

## Next steps

I would propose a discussion at this issue and I'll update this text accordingly.

We should also remove ""Tools -> Legacy Tools..."".

_Tested on current state of branch 2.11_dev_"11/13/15 07:04:11 AM[WIP] Improvements to search"This is a new version of my old pull request, now updated to the 2.8 version and incorporating all the suggestions from the last time. (Except the clean commit history )

The changes include:
- Search bar is now at the top
- Autocompletion suggestions are shown in a popup
- Search options are available via a drop-down list, this implements Feature Request #853
- ""Clear search"" button also clears search field, this implements Feature Request #601
- In incremental search mode: next result is selected by pressing enter (instead of Control + F as previously)
- Incremental search now uses the same search engine as the other search modes
- Added a new search mode (Live filter) which filters the table as soon as the search text is changed

I have a few questions:
- ~~There are quite a few changes from formatting the code in Eclipse. Is it ok if I include them?~~
- I have a problem with listening to changes in the textfield and programatically setting the text with setText(). The latter command triggers first an event for the deletion of the text and then another one for inserting the new one. Is there a way to be informed just once about such a change? (This occours in the following case: if the user accepts an autocompletion, then the text is changed via setText(). Thus, in incremental and live filter mode, two searches are performed.)
- ~~The SearchWorker implemented the AbstractWorker interface. As far as I understood, this enables one to do work asynchronously and then change the GUI later. However, the worker is simply run via 
      worker.getWorker().run();
      worker.getCallBack().update();
  In my understanding, this defeats completely the purpose of using the AbstractWorker. What is the right way to run it?~~
- ~~A general observation about the `SearchRule` class. Every method of it takes the query as an argument. I would propose to save the query internally in  `SearchRule` and thus simplify the interface a little bit.~~
- ~~The setting ""Autocomplete names"" is not yet implemented. In my opinion this can be completely removed.~~
- ~~The setting ""Select matches"" is not yet implemented since I do not understand the purpose of this setting. Should it control whatever the first match is selected after the search is performed? Moreover, I think it was not implemented in the old search pane.~~

Things which should be done at some point (I will open a ticket after this pull request was accepted):
- All the other inline autocompletions (in fields for example) should also use the new dropdown style autocompleter
