XMP is an extremely interesting feature that allows tagging PDF files (amongst others) with automatically retrievable metadata in much the same way mp3-tags allow adding title/author/... information to mp3 music files. Actually JabRef exports the metadata not only to two XMP namespaces (Dublin Core and a custom JabRef namespace), but also to the PDF DocumentInformation Object.\n\nPractically from the beginning of the XMP-writing capabilities of JabRef, Christopher Oezbek had added _privacy filtering_ for the XMP-tagging of PDF-files with data from the bibtex-record, meaning that the user could define a list of fields (in Preferences->XMP metadata) which should _not_ be exported to the PDF file.  Unfortunately, the filtering was incomplete: jabref exports the metadata in three different forms, only one of which was originally filtered. In 2013 filtering was extended to both XMP namespaces, but JabRef still exported _all_ fields into the PDF DocumentInfo object. The two present commits correct this problem. The first (b45316f) prevents private fields from being exported to the PDF DocumentInfo. The second one more agressively erases these fields even if they already exist in the PDF document. \n\nThe deletion of existing fields might be debateable. It seems the right thing to do for fields clearly generated by JabRef (viz. those prefixed by \"jabref/\"), but there are four fields which might be of other origin (Author,Title,Subject and Keywords). Making a systematic exception for these four fields, i.e. not erasing them even if they are privacy filtered, is a bad idea and violates the principle of least surprise. This is why the second commit makes no exception. Deactivating the erasure for the four generic fields could however easily be added as an option in the XMP export preferences if it is judged important. The current behaviour has the advantage of reliably correcting PDF files previously tagged with a buggy privacy filtering.\n\nIf these commits are pulled into the master branch and confirmed to work, the bug #869 on the sourceforge tracker: \nhttps://sourceforge.net/p/jabref/bugs/869/\ncan be closed.", "thx!\n =||= "], ["9", "Support FindFullText with ACS DOIs", "Peter Ansell", "ansell", "05/20/14, 12:53:43 PM", "Adds a FullTextFinder implementation to transform the ACS DOI redirect URLs to their PDF download equivalents.", "NaN"], ["10", "try to fix some obvious bugs about `groups`", null, "braindevices", "05/20/14, 12:55:20 PM", "Hi All,\nI just upgraded to 2.10 and I found some bugs immediately.\n1. in the right-click-menu there is no `move-to-group` but 2 `remove\nfrom group` instead.\n2.

(as you see this is not my prefer display style)\n\nIn general, I conclude that:\n- Help should be expanded.\n- The search GUI should be reorganized to avoid mixing things, no?\n =||= I suggest to make it simpler by\n- removing incremental search\n- make float the default search and hide the other options\n- bring caseSensitive and isRegex to the front as they have an impact on the search results\n\nI do not have good suggestions on scope and the dialog option, as they are intertwined. A global search always opens up in a dialog. \n =||= Currently, the various possibilities take 6 lines. Let's try to keep it as compact, or even smaller\nHere is the design I suggest:\n- Floating | Filter | New window\n  (a dropdown menu with the 3 possibilities, which displays the selected one)\n- Local | Global\n  (and selecting global automatically selects New window and invalidates the possibility of selecting Floating or Filter)\n- RegEx (on/off)\n- Case sensitive (on/off)\n- Parameters\n  (\"Parameters\" is always displayed)\n  - Autocomplete (on/off)\n  - Highlight (on/off)\n\nOnly 5 lines, and still explicit about the (important) choices\n\nBTW, why not to contact our GUI specialist?\n =||= Minor comment: pressing `ctrl`+`f` when the focus is on the search field, the type of the search changes. I would vote to remove this functionality and just highlight the searched word as Firefox does.\n =||= Ahhh, instead of 103 what I should have written in the commit message I wrote 104. What a mess.\n =||= I think this is related to #162\n =||= In #162, there is also the \"live\" option which does everything after each keystroke. \n =||= Current road map for the new search\n- [x] remove incremental search\n- [x] remove select matches option\n- [x] remove autocomplete on/off option and make this on by default\n- [x] make float search live\n- [x] handle global/local and in window/new window: \n\nThis should reduce the complexity of the search. \n =||= Can you please elaborate on why the incremental and filter search should be removed?\nI agree that the incremental search is an edge case and probably not very often used, but the filter option is in my opinion very important. Indeed, it is my standard search mode. There are a few use cases where filter is superior to float (and not just an optical difference). For example, filtering items and then Control + A, followed by some action allows to easily apply the action just to the filtered items. \n\nBut even the incremental search has some use cases. It is a good search mode whenever the context of the other non-matched items is important (which is admittedly not very often). (This is why Control + G jumps to the given position in most text editors instead of just displaying the single line :mask:)\n\nIn my opinion, the search is one of the most underdeveloped areas in JabRef and I can't see how removing search modes helps here. (Indeed, quite often I don't understand why some features should be removed. It would be ok if we try to implement something new and the old code posses a problem. Then removing the old feature is ok in my eyes. But just removing for the purpose of removing is not very profitable.) \n =||= JabRef at the moment has a few issues:\n- Most of the code is untested, undocumented and contains a lot of bugs/issues.\n- Over the lifetime of JabRef, a lot of features, UI elements and preferences were added. All of them are loosely fit together in the UI, but the UI lacks consistency and structure. \n\nThis makes working on JabRef interesting as in every part of the program, one can improve something. :)\n\nJabRef 3.0 is the first effort to try to fix a lot of these issues. But with the available man-power we have at the moment, it is not feasible to keep all the existing features and fix/rewrite them so that we can maintain them again. We currently use three approaches: a) rewrite and put under test to improve quality and fix bugs, b) replace preference options with fixed values to reduce the number of available options, and c) remove features that have never worked or are extremely rarely used.\n\nRegarding the search functionality, we wanted to apply b and c. You applied a in your PR, but without the tests. I am open to rescue the search modes within an effort to reduce the overall complexity of the search and make it more usable. If you like, we can talk via a skype call regarding this. \n\nFor me, the most annoying this regarding search are:\n- local vs. global: in other applications, a local search within a file is normally completely separated from a global search. The global search is done in a separate window, see Sublime, Eclipse, IntelliJ, etc. whereas the local search is done within the file view. The results of the global search are also shown in a separate window wheres the ones in the local file are not. What is more, when having two databases open, and I issues a search query in one of them, and I switch to the other one, the search query is still displayed in the search window but not applied, creating even more confusion. \n- The options regex and case sensitive are hidden, but they are extremely relevant as the three elements (query, regex, case sensitive) decide which entries match and which do not. Hence, they should be always visible so that the user can easily \"debug\" why the results are shown this way. This is typical for IDEs as well, see sublime search etc.\n =||= Thanks @simonharrer for the explanations. They helped a lot in understanding your/the teams reasoning. You should add a few of these sentences to the wiki! \nI just want to add that one of the big selling points of Jabref is its customizability. There is probably no other reference manager with the same amount of preference options :). \n\nRegarding the search options: all the (main) open issues are ui-problems, right? So wouldn't it be a better strategy to wait with further modifications of the search until we have a new ui concept for Jabref? \n =||= Hm, good points. Will do that. \n\nRegarding customizability, this is an interesting point. We should discuss this in the next dev-call as well. \n\nRegarding the search options: yes, you are right, but we do not know how long the port to JavaFX will take. So we have to decide in that trade-off. Something for the dev-call, maybe.\n\nThank you for the comment.\n =||= @tobiasdiez have a look at the current results of the search-improvements branch. I adapted your code and created a search ui per tab, making it local to each database with an option to do a global search as well. \n =||= Good work! A few remarks:\n- now in filter and float mode the search happens after every text change. This should work in most cases and is an useful default. Did you tried it also with very large databases? I could imagine that in such cases the search is too slow to trigger it after with every text change. \n- all the icons are wrong (probably wrong font?)\n- the search settings popup is not connected to the button\n- do you really think that all this control buttons for regex / case sensitive are really so important to be shown that dominantly? I never changed these options and would trust Jabref with sensible default values. The same applies essentially to all of the controls you added. For me, most of these different possibilities are nice-to-have but i rarely change or need them (e.g. global search and results in dialog). Most of the times I do Ctrl + F -> type author or keyword -> look at results. But maybe this is just me.\n  So for the UI, I'm an advocate of clean and minimalistic interfaces. But since this is a UI change, I stop to have strong opinions about this for now and begin arguing again when we discuss UI issues next year *_promise :) *_\n- Ok, on UI thing: could you please set the background of the new search toolbar to white?\n =||= Help! I cannot close the \"settings\" pop up :cry: \n\nYou removed the \"toggle search bar\" option completely - so it should not be possible to close the search bar?\n\nApart from this: Awesome! \n\n@tobiasdiez  Simon already posted an explanation regarding case sensitivity and regex above:\n\n> The options regex and case sensitive are hidden, but they are extremely relevant as the three elements (query, regex, case sensitive) decide which entries match and which do not. Hence, they should be always visible so that the user can easily \"debug\" why the results are shown this way.

Microsoft Office, Google, Windows, Firefox as well as all music and reference library manager I looked at just show a search field without any settings buttons. If we focus on power users than it is ok to show these buttons (since then the target audience should be similar to the one of code editors). But if we want to provide a reference manager for everybody (not even necessarily Latex users), then we should orient ourselves at the usual office programs. But this is a discussion which we should have before changing ui things...\n\nAt least I would like to have an option to show/hide all these buttons. I also welcome an option to toggle between my minimalistic and your more elaborate approach. (regarding \"we have to many configuration options\", you may have a look at the motivation for creating the Vivaldi browser)\n\n+1 for the little \"x\"\n =||= At least Firefox has a \"case sensitive\" option ;-)\n\nI see your point, but the difference between the MS Office and the other searches is: MS Office only provides a \"dumb\" feature which is not configurable - if you provide some configurations, the settings affecting the search result should be displayed - and if shown as \"toggle buttons\" it is also easy to change them afterwards without the need of opening a popup menu.\n\n> I also welcome an option to toggle between my minimalistic and your more elaborate approach. \n\nThis would be a valid option yes!\n\nHowever, I think we should use our time for more crucial discussions ;-)\n =||= Implemented your suggestions except the X within the search field - this is quite complicated to do with a lot of UI hacks. I could offer a clear button if this is really required. \n =||= Ok, please have a look at the current version of #332 which is good to go from my point of view. \n =||= @simonharrer  and  @tobiasdiez  commented on Nov 11 2015 about \n\n>  remove incremental search\n\nI was running an older JabRef version that had search in the LHS panel, but now it is in the Tab and I can't find where to turn off incremental search. This is a major PIA, because I have a very large .bib file and the incremental search messes up typing in the search field because of the lag as it incrementally searches 45Mb.\n\nAm I not seeing the setting, or has it VERY UNFORTUNATELY been removed as the post seem to say?  Should I request it be reinstated as a feature request? Incremental ON makes searching very frustrating. Can I set in manually OFF in a config file?\n =||= Yes, as far as I know the incremental search was removed.\nHowever, I think, you mean something different. Incremental was a search mode, which jumpened from one hit to the next one, similar to how the search feature works in mayor browsers. On the other hand, your problems seems to be that JabRef searches as soon as the input in the search field is varied. I am not aware of an option to disable this automatic search but can understand that it might be a problem for very big databases. Can you please open an new issue for it.

Some of the formatters should be a) integrated as default auto formatters b) removed because they really don't make a lot of sense.\n4. Most license problems are caused by these classes.\n# List\n\n> - **Authors** : this formatter provides formatting options for the author and editor fields; for detailed information, see below. It deprecates a range of dedicated formatters provided in versions of JabRef prior to 2.7.\n> - **CreateBibORDFAuthors** : formats authors for according to the requirements of the Bibliographic Ontology (bibo).\n> - **CreateDocBookAuthors** : formats the author field in DocBook style.\n> - **CreateDocBookEditors** : formats the editor field in DocBook style.\n> - **CurrentDate**: outputs the current date. With no argument, this formatter outputs the current date and time in the format \"yyyy.MM.dd hh:mm:ss z\" (date, time and time zone). By giving a different format string as argument, the date format can be customized. E.g. \\format[CurrentDate]{yyyy.MM.dd} will give the date only, e.g. 2005.11.30.\n> - Default : takes a single argument, which serves as a default value. If the string to format is non-empty, it is output without changes. If it is empty, the default value is output. For instance, \\format[Default(unknown)]{\\year} will output the entry's year if set, and \"unknown\" if no year is set.\n> \n> **DOIStrip**: strips any prefixes from the DOI string.\n\nShould be automatically integrated as sensible default!\n\n> **DOICheck** : provides the full url for a DOI link.\n\nDOICheck as name makes no sense. Rename at least to DOILink.\n\n> - FileLink(filetype) : if no argument is given, this formatter outputs the first external file link encoded in the field. To work, the formatter must be supplied with the contents of the \"file\" field.\n>   This formatter takes the name of an external file type as an optional argument, specified in parentheses after the formatter name. For instance, \\format[FileLink(pdf)]{\\file} specifies pdf as an argument. When an argument is given, the formatter selects the first file link of the specified type. In the example, the path to the first PDF link will be output.\n> - FirstPage : returns the first page from the \"pages\" field, if set. For instance, if the pages field is set to \"345-360\" or \"345--360\", this formatter will return \"345\".\n> - FormatChars : This formatter converts LaTeX character sequences their equicalent unicode characters and removes other LaTeX commands without handling them.\n> - FormatPagesForHTML : replaces \"--\" with \"-\".\n> - FormatPagesForXML : replaces \"--\" with an XML en-dash.\n> - GetOpenOfficeType : returns the number used by the OpenOffice.org bibliography system (versions 1.x and 2.x) to denote the type of this entry.\n> - HTMLChars : replaces TeX-specific special characters (e.g. {^a} or {\\\"{o}}) with their HTML representations, and translates LaTeX commands \\emph, \\textit, \\textbf into HTML equivalents.\n> - HTMLParagraphs : interprets two consecutive newlines (e.g. \\n \\n) as the beginning of a new paragraph and creates paragraph-html-tags accordingly.\n> - IfPlural : outputs its first argument if the input field looks like an author list with two or more names, or its second argument otherwise. E.g. \\format[IfPlural(Eds.,Ed.)]{\\editor} will output \"Eds.\" if there is more than one editor, and \"Ed.\" if there is only one.\n> - JournalAbbreviator : The given input text is abbreviated according to the journal abbreviation lists. If no abbreviation for input is found (e.g. not in list or already abbreviated), the input will be returned unmodified. For instance, when using \\format[JournalAbbreviator]{\\journal}, \"Physical Review - Letters\" gets \"Phys. Rev. Lett.\"\n> - LastPage : returns the last page from the \"pages\" field, if set. For instance, if the pages field is set to \"345-360\" or \"345--360\", this formatter will return \"360\".\n> - NoSpaceBetweenAbbreviations : LayoutFormatter that removes the space between abbreviated First names. Example: J. R. R. Tolkien becomes J.R.R. Tolkien.\n> - NotFoundFormatter : Formatter used to signal that a formatter hasn't been found. This can be used for graceful degradation if a layout uses an undefined format.\n> - Number : outputs the 1-based sequence number of the current entry in the current export. This formatter can be used to make a numbered list of entries. The sequence number depends on the current entry's place in the current sort order, not on the number of calls to this formatter.\n> \n> **RemoveBrackets** : removes all curly brackets \"{\" or \"}\".\n\nThis just removes **all** brackets without checking for escape sequences or such, e.g. {.\n\n> **RemoveBracketsAddComma**: removes all curly brackets \"{\" or \"}\". The closing curly bracket is replaced by a comma.\n\nI don't see any use case where I want to do this.\n- RemoveLatexCommands : removes LaTeX commands like \\em, \\textbf, etc. If used together with HTMLChars or XMLChars, this formatter should be called last.\n\n> **RemoveTilde**: replaces the tilde character used in LaTeX as a non-breakable space by a regular space. Useful in combination with the NameFormatter discussed in the next section.\n> \n> **RemoveWhitespace**: removes all whitespace characters.\n\nWhere would this make any sense?\n\n> - Replace(regexp,replacewith) : does a regular expression replacement. To use this formatter, a two-part argument must be given. The parts are separated by a comma. To indicate the comma character, use an escape sequence: \\, \u00a0 The first part is the regular expression to search for. Remember that any commma character must be preceded by a backslash, and consequently a literal backslash must be written as a pair of backslashes. A description of Java regular expressions can be found at: \u00a0http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html \u00a0 The second part is the text to replace all matches with.\n> \n> **RisAuthors** : to be documented.\n> **RisKeywords** : to be documented.\n> **RisMonth** : to be documented.\n\n[Biblioscape](http://www.biblioscape.com/) formatter?\n\n> - RTFChars : replaces TeX-specific special characters (e.g. {^a} or {\\\"{o}}) with their RTF representations, and translates LaTeX commands \\emph, \\textit, \\textbf into RTF equivalents.\n> - ToLowerCase : turns all characters into lower case.\n> - ToUpperCase : turns all characters into upper case.\n> - WrapContent : This formatter outputs the input value after adding a prefix and a postfix, as long as the input value is non-empty. If the input value is empty, an empty string is output (the prefix and postfix are not output in this case). The formatter requires an argument containing the prefix and postix separated by a comma.

Since JabRef is written in Java, whatever we are extracting from it will also be Java.\r\n\r\nSo if you want to use such an extracted library, you would have to write a small Java wrapper that processes command line calls and invokes the library.

Without a blank line inbetween, it might get confusing.\n =||= @koppor: At this moment, the current approach for the field ordering seems fine to me. I do not mind a blank line and then an alphabetic restart. However, I would not like it if, for example, the (relatively long) \"Abstract\" comes before the \"author\", \"year\", etc. Apart from that, an alphabetic order has never been required by any *.bib-file processing code as far as I know (but my experience is too small to make a generically valid statement about that).\n =||= 4330d94044a4dbc1d4e035a2895dd0ca380452e4 removes the blank line between required and optional fields.\n\n@koppor: You can close the bug reports on source forge.

Dropping all field saving options (Preferences -> File -> Field saving options)\n- [x] Fields are sorted as stated in the Bibtex / Biblatex manuals.\n- [x] The `=` is appended directly to the field key. The `value` part is indented to one space past the longest field key name + `=` (so that all values are aligned).\n- [x] Bibtex entry keys are written in camel case, starting upper case\n- [x] Field keys are formatted in lower case only\n- [x] No longer perform any changes of field content (no more space/tab/newline elimination, etc.)\n- [x] Provide formatter (Example: Remove tabs / newlines / duplicate spaces) that can be enabled by a user for specific fields onLoad / onSave. These are not enabled by default.\n- [x] If in doubt, do as biber does", "1. We should **NOT** add compatibility patches. We want people to switch to JabRef 3.\n2. We should probably revert some changes to be more BibTeX conform. **We want to encourage usage of JabRef not plain editing and readability of bib files**.\n   -  Remove the blank line (see #115)\n   -  Revert capitalization of second word of BibTex type and just use the standard tag (to investigate)\n   -  Revert camel casing of field names\n\nDunno what `Configurable: Start field contents in same column. Enabled by default` means, yet.\n =||= JabRef is BibTeX conform. There are habits only :)\n\nI think, we should enable readability as the `.bib` files can be put under version control, compared, quickly edited, etc. Otherwise, we produce a kind of a binary format, which is hard to handle in version control systems (see versioned .docx documents).\n\nI tend to like the new format. We can discuss whether we remove the casing again. I got used to it, but no one else offers such a format.\n\nMaybe we should start a wiki page with all possible formats and vote on the preferred format and implement that.\n\n### Configuration options\n\nSee Options -> Preferences -> File -> \"Field saving options\"\n- Use camel case for field names\n- Start field contents in same column\n- Include empty fields\n- Wrap fields as ver 2.9.2\n- Field sorting options: alphabetic, unsorted, user-defined order\n\nFurthermore, one can configure the ordering of the entries: See \"Database properties\": Save as configured globally, original order, order as specified.\n\nShould we drop all these options and define \"the one and only\" serialization? What about being as minimal intrusive as possible? For instance, when a group of researchers uses different tools to manage their bibliographies?\n =||= Sharing a file while using a revision control software causes trouble if the Field saving options are not identical among users.\nHence, to facilitate sharing, I suggest to add in the See Options -> Preferences -> File -> \"Field saving options\" a \"master switch\" named something like \"Default sharing format\".  That way, to make sharing smooth, users will simply have to ensure this single switch is selected. \nI do not know which of the 5 above options should be selected/unselected by the \"Default sharing format\" switch, but I am sure that ensuring that everybody have the same settings among 5 options is going to be a pain.\n =||= Considering the configuration options you mentioned, Olly, i would suggest to remove (most of) them and just define one format for JabRef that suits our ideas and concept. This removes the problems that mlep described.\n =||= Well, \"one format [...] that suits our ideas and concept\", may not suit users... \nThese could be because of personal preferences or because of compatibility with other software. So, I would suggest to keep the possibility of various field saving options.\n =||= I think, this is the discussion GNOMEv2 vs. GNOMEv3, where they removed various configuration options. I see the following options:\n\nA) Remove all configuration options and introduce a \"one size fits all\" format\nB) Keep everything as is\nC) Add support for the old 2.9.2 format\n\nA) This increases testability (as less configuration combinations have to be tested) and eases sharing of BibTeX files across JabRef users.\nB) We still have to add test cases. - Side comment: At \"database properties\", one can add the file sorting options. We could add a button \"make database ready for sharing\" or, even better, set a suitable default JabRef configuration. As soon as the old version vanish (and the users have reset their preferences), additional configuration is only required for special cases\nC) This causes much effort (at least 20h) and is only because there are users not updating their software. Even [debian stable has JabRef v2.10](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/jabref).\n\nIn all cases, we should check whether [other BibTeX-based managers](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/wiki/Alternatives#bibtex-based) or compatible. We can also neglect them and assume that other BibTeX managers are used seldomly. The Microsoft Office way ^^.\n =||= I agree with you all, there is no _wrong_ or _right_ here. My main argument is that \n- configuration makes usage difficult as you **have to know how** to configure and that there is a configuration option for certain features\n- makes portability problematic as there might be **a lot of different** user configurations\n- is a **threat** to testing and stability because of various possible states of configuration\n\nTherefore my personal principles\n- should only be used if there is a **real** benefit by this configuration option\n- the good old **convention over configuration** concept really condenses my personal favors. \n =||= To me, C) should not be implemented. When a new version (of a freely available software) is released, it is the responsibility of the user if he/she want to use the old version.\nBetween A and B, I favor B: if the default settings are the best for sharing, it is the responsibility of the user to use another configuration. And to report a bug if he/she find one (so, the user does the testing ;-) )\n =||= Regarding C), I get more bug reports than usual, which is an indicator that it is important for our users. See [sf feature request #864](https://sourceforge.net/p/jabref/feature-requests/864/) and related bugs. I can be the bad guy and just say \"We don't have resources for that. If someone volunteers, we will include the patch.\". Or we could collect donations for it. Or we should put it in the survey as option for next development (what we currently have)?\n\n[FLOSS COACH says](http://www.flosscoach.com/index.php/my-coach/jabref): \"some people are direct, critical or seem to be rude.\"  :sunglasses:\n =||= Well, if C) is a feature requested by user, I guess it should be kept...\nAnd if the main contributors to JabRef do not have time to do it, I do not see anything bad about asking the community for a volunteer. \n =||= I'll throw in my hat for option A.\n\nFrom my point of view, JabRef has gotten so complex and ill-structured that there's a considerable risk that it will die because no one can maintain or extend it anymore. Following this logic, anything that reduces complexity, even if we lose features, is desirable.\n =||= Regarding A). If we follow that, we should use the sort order given by the biblatex manual (Sections 2.1.1 and 2.1.2). We should also go back to field names written in lowercase letters. OK, this sort odering is also not always optimal: in `incollection`, the `introduction` comes before `subtitle`. Nevertheless, the current serialization is strange in the case of `article`: The `number` comes before `volume` and inbetween, there is `pages`.\n =||= Regarding the field ordering, I guess [the btxdoc reference available here](https://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/biblio/bibtex/base?lang=de) is the ultimate source. Sect. 3.1, p. 8, states that _\"The  fields within each class (required or optional) are listed in order of occurrence in the output, except that a few entry types may perturb the order slightly, depending on  what  fields  are  missing.\"_ \n\nHence, I would suggest that we hard code the order defined in the manual (easy, can be done during the definition of bibtex entries). Unknown fields can be sorted alphabetically after known fields. Btw.: where do entry types, such as \"patent\" or \"periodical\" come from?\n =||= I am also for **A)**. The reason i made some of the options configurable was to support old use of JabRef and keep the option to decide if such \"_pretty_\" formatting would eventually be accepted.\n\nI am using VCS for bibliographies and papers and I also share bibliographies between papers, e.g. using GIT modules. Therefore a unified \"_pretty_\" formatting always contributed to orientation in a BibTeX files and effectiveness during changes. I would be definitely against some binary-like serialization. BibTeX is a plain/text file and should be IMHO also readable using other tools, supporting  text-view only, e.g. Overleaf (where such formatting also contributes to better orientation especially in huge BibTeX files).\n\nAFAIK camel-case is not a problem in BibTeX but contributes to readability.\n\nSorting: `title` first, `required fields`, `optional fields`, `other fields`, grouped and separated with an empty line helps to understand the BibTeX structure when viewed in plain text. Fixed sorting in groups (alphabetically) also contributes to orientation and less conflicts during changes in VCS.\n\nIf the order has some compatibility issues, as **Lenhard** said, or some rules are saying that, e.g., `volume` should come before `number`, then I would also be for making fix (hard-coded) ordering of `required` and `optional fields`. But I would still keep alphabetical order of `other fields` and spaces between the groups and CamelCase.\n\nMy suggestion would be to remove as much as possible configuration elements and keep only those which are necessary (in my opinion none of those regarding formatting are). Maybe enable some \"_advanced_\" mode where some configuration is possible. Fix serialization supporting as much as possible readable BibTeX source.\n\nBackwards compatibility regarding this issue is in my opinion not necessary. New version can still read files produced by old versions and vice-versa. New version produces new formatting, old version old formatting. The user can decide which version (s)he will use. If used along with VCS than the will be one commit with the \"_JabRef upgrade_\" comment :-) And from that point new commits will be \"_pretty_\".\n =||= @lenhard:  About \"patent\" and \"periodical\" (but also \"standard\" and \"electronic\"), I believe they come from IEEE. See http://mirror.ibcp.fr/pub/CTAN/macros/latex/contrib/IEEEtran/bibtex/IEEEtran_bst_HOWTO.pdf\n =||= I think we are nearning a consensus :-) We will decide the issue during the next developer conference call.\n\nI largely agree with @kubovy maybe expect for:\n- When it comes to camel casing of field names, I would rather stick to the bibtex manual as close as possible\n- The empty space between required/optional/other fields has been removed in #115 \n\n@mlep: Thanks! We can use that guide as a reference to fix the field ordering as well.\n =||= http://www.bibtex.org/Format/ they use for example: @STRING and @string -> it is case **insensitive**. IMHO camel-case formatting is just about how it appears to the human eye. Also there is this example:\n\n```\n@article{mrx05, \n    auTHor = \"Mr. X\", \n    Title = {Something Great}, \n    publisher = \"nob\" # \"ody\", \n    YEAR = 2005, \n} \n```\n =||= Sorry for a late instep, but what about biblatex?\n =||= @bluebirch: I'd say we treat biblatex in the same fashion as bibtex. Code-wise, this should make no difference. In JabRef's model, a biblatex entry is also a `BibtexEntry`. Sorting of fields can be taken from the [the biblatex manual](http://ftp.uni-erlangen.de/ctan/macros/latex/contrib/biblatex/doc/biblatex.pdf).\n\n@kubovy: The parser should be able to parse the camel casing (I should write a test). The idea is to remove it when writing back the file.\n =||= @lenhard: Totally agree. Fully satisfied with that answer. ;-)\n =||= Since we were discussing the serialization format in a wider public in this issue, I'd like to document our decisions from yesterday's conference call here:\n\nRationale: People are very emotional about formatting -> Modify as little as possible in the bib file\n\nFor the concrete checks, see the initial post.\n =||= Nice!\nHave you talked about some default settings for collaborative work using a VCS?\n =||= What do you mean by default settings? By removing all configuration options, we are VCS ready. The only thing what was difficult to decide is regarding \"New entries are added to the bottom of the file\". This will really cause issues when two collaborators are adding entries. The decision was that we cannot assume a particular order of the entries in the bibtex file. And if we add something after the first match, that could be wrong. First match is something like: First place of bibtex key or first place when considering sorting according to author, title, year. For instance, existing keys: `a`, `d`, `f`, `c`., new key `b` would be added after `a`, even the list was not sorted.\n =||= I was thinking about a way of ensuring all users have the same settings for the formatters (for example) when a file is used for collaborative work.\nThis could be set by a dedicated file property. If set, JabRef will use the default formatters (and not the user configuration). Just an idea. \n =||= @mlep There won't be any configuration settings any more. Nothing more to worry about different settings. This also makes  #180 obsolete.\n =||= > -  Fixed and non-configurable format (dropping several configuration options) for new or modified entries. Fields are sorted as stated in the Bibtex / Biblatex manuals. the = value part is indented to one space past the longest field key name (so that all values are aligned).\n\nOkay - Olly was faster ;-) \n\nSo the only requirement is: all users should use the same (new) JabRef version.\n =||= @koppor & @matthiasgeiger :\nFrom a previous discussion, I understood that we will not have any settings for the file content.\nBut in this thread, I read: \n\n> Provide formatter (Example: Remove tabs / newlines / duplicate spaces) that can be enabled by a user for specific fields onLoad / onSave. These are not enabled by default.\n\nWhat if the user does not use the default formatter settings?

Either, because I want to paste a reference in a review, I work with Microsoft Word managing the references by hand, or I just quickly send around a reference to users not using BibTeX as serialization format. Currently, JabRef cannot be configured quickly to render Springer or IEEE styled entries: One has to use a combination of HTML and the formatters to get the desired result.\n\n[CitationStyles](http://citationstyles.org/) is the new way to offer rendering of bibliographic data. Currently JabRef offers following two possibilities to format BibTeX entries\n- Through [JabRef's formatters](http://jabref.sourceforge.net/help/CustomExports.php), which are used at the export or at the preview panel\n- Through bibtex (`bst`) and biblatex ([biblatex-styles](https://de.sharelatex.com/learn/Biblatex_citation_styles)) - when using in a latex document\n\nI am aware that another options causes more trouble.

After finishing the edit the whole edit is reverted using Ctrl-Z.\nPeople who do not use the shortcut are only able to undo whole edits. \n =||= I think, I went through the same thinkings:\nA) Consistency with other programs (CTRL+z and menu action always the same behavior)\nB) \"intuitive\" use of CTRL+z\n\n:+1: for keeping as-is: A rewrite that the global action behaves like the CTRL+z action causes too much effort.\n =||= @JabRef/developers Will we ever work on this or should we close it as a reference.\n =||= We probably should, but we probably won't :-)\n\nThere is simply too much work to be done and so far no real user has complained about this.\n =||= Can we tag it as unimportant?

I will take this opportunity to clean up my preferences then \u2026 :wink: \n =||= @matthiasgeiger I would set my preferences manually, if it would work. But unfortunately, I can not change any preferences except the language setting. As I said, whenever I click on OK in the preferences pane, nothing happens. This is also the case with version 2.11b3, which had worked before. Any hints?\n =||= Ahh... that is crap :disappointed: \n\nUnfortunately we cannot reproduce this issue as no one of the current developers is using a Mac. \n\nA weird workaround might be to use v2.10 to set the preferences which than can be used in v2.11bX\n =||= @domwass Could you start it using the terminal and `java -jar`? Then we might see some exceptions popping up. Alternatively, you could open \"Help\" -> \"Show Errror Console\" and then have a look at the Exceptions tab.\n =||= @matthiasgeiger I will try v2.10 later.\n@koppor Error console says:\n\n```\nException in thread \"AWT-EventQueue-0\" java.lang.NullPointerException\nat net.sf.jabref.AdvancedTab.storeSettings(Unknown Source)\nat net.sf.jabref.PrefsDialog3$OkAction$1.run(Unknown Source)\nat sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)\nat sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:39)\nat sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:25)\nat java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:597)\nat spin.Invocation.evaluate(Invocation.java:175)\nat spin.off.SpinOffEvaluator$1.run(SpinOffEvaluator.java:108)\nat java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:695)\n```\n =||= Okay... I think I got it. \n\nThere is no \"default look and feel\" set for Mac OSX, therefore the (not visible for Mac OS X) dropdown box in the AdvancedTab of the Preferences for selecting the LookAndFeel is empty and the NullPointerException is caused by the `toString()` call in `preferences.put(JabRefPreferences.WIN_LOOK_AND_FEEL, className.getSelectedItem().toString());`\n\nWhat is the lookAndFeel to be used on a mac? \n`UIManager.getSystemLookAndFeelClassName()` or `UIManager.getCrossPlatformLookAndFeelClassName()` (== metal)? \n =||= I just added `UIManager.getSystemLookAndFeelClassName()` as the default value in the prefs.\n\n@domwass It would be great if you would check whether this solves the problem using this snapshot build: https://circle-artifacts.com/gh/JabRef/jabref/655/artifacts/0/home/ubuntu/jabref/build/releases/JabRef-2.80dev--snapshot--2015-10-08--2da8161-OSX.zip\n =||= Yes, this works \u2013 thanks. I can now change the preferences \u2013 and it also works in 2.11b3 again. \n\nAnother problem that I encountered using the snapshot, though: I enabled the biblatex mode and left everything else as is. After closing and re-opening JabRef, the table is blank (white), although the data is there. (I attached a screenshot.) With 2.11b3 everything is fine.\n![biblatex-mode](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2708770/10366945/d5ba039a-6dcd-11e5-9366-e4a5d9cf2ca4.jpg)\n =||= @matthiasgeiger Can you backport your fix to 2.11 with reasonable effort? Trying to close the last issues for 2.11 final release on 10/31/15.\n =||= Yeah, should be possible.\n =||= Merged into master (https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/commit/7d07e3921fcae5326744de1152e67e88895055aa) and backported to dev2.11 in https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/commit/11d486cf477d39261a7375cb9854b8b1bb73e158.\n =||= @domwass The build can be retrieved from http://ge.tt/9Idc446\n =||= @koppor Thanks, I just did a quick test and it seems to work.\n =||= Glad to here ;-) \nSo let's try to close this issue again...\n =||= "], ["150", "Removes the legacy-action Integrity Check", "Simon Harrer", "simonharrer", "10/29/15, 02:50:22 PM", "Removes the **legacy**-action `Tools--> Legacy Tools... --> Integrity Check` with all its files. \n\nWhat it helps:\n- removes 1000 lines of code\n- removes a feature that is marked as a legacy tool\n\nWhat does the feature do at the moment:\n- check year: raise error if it contains a 4digit number\n- check title: warn only about wrong braces\n- check author/editor: check that the structure is correct using `and` and the `,` separator.\n\nAnyone who wants this feature to stay?\n\nIs there any other validation facility in place where we could add the checks instead?", "Wow, the features look impressive!\n\nDoes it check for presence or absence of 4 digit year number? I think, presence of 4 digits makes sense?\n\nWrong braces: Maybe we should have two modes for a bibtex file - collecting and paper writing (see  #113). And for paper writing, we should have some brace check. In the collecting mode, no braces should be used at all.\n\nAuthor/editor check: What a useful tool. I'm always struggling with that.\n\nWe should keep these checks! The checks should be **moved** to the fields: If a field looses the focus, the check should be fired. If the field is wrong, the field should be colored in red.\n =||= Is there already a similar check for another field in place? Or should we\njust Mark the Entry red in the table as when there is something missing?\n =||= At least the BibTex-Key is currently checked (e.g., spaces are not allowed).\n =||= There is already a related feature discussion here: #131 \n =||= I even didn't know the check for the BibTex key. JabRef really insists on correct BibTeX keys there...\n\nAn entry as a whole is marked in red if something is wrong: The number in the first column gets a red background. I suppose, it is only marked if a required field is missing. In the case of `article` additionally, if `volume` and `pages` is missing. But there is no fly-over-help at the red number :worried:\n =||= Hm, this is a lot of effort to put a system in place which can handle such checks and validations in a sensible way. \n\nMaybe we can leverage the tool tip text that is set in the IncompleteRenderer. But I cannot see the tool tip text in JabRef ...\n =||= Is it an aspect for #113? Maybe we should close this pull request and add a new issue to implement the checking behavior. JabRef should support the user whenever possible :smiley:\n =||= Large UPDATE:\n- [x] refactored existing integrity checks and provide test cases for them\n- [x] instead of complex GUI elements, use a simple results table for displaying the validation results\n- [x] instead of having separate language property files for a few keys, use the default ones\n- [x] minimal but working example of such a validation\n\nI propose to merge this as this has more value than the \"legacy\" implementation before. \n =||= Great, that this integrity message resource properties are gone now ;-) \n\nAnd for the first time this feature seems to work :wink:\n\nNot sure how much time it requires to implement, but a nice feature would be to open the affected entry and setting the cursor in the affected field when selecting a found integrity issue. \n\nAnother minor aspect: the results table currently wastes a lot of space for the affected field but the message is not completely readible.\n =||= Good ideas. But I think the current state is good enough to have a usable and helpful feature.\n =||= I think the aspects above are rather crucial for good usability - I will check how easy this can be implemented...\n =||= Done. :metal:\n =||= :trophy: awesome. \n =||= Bug: when the field for which the validation files is not required, the field is not found. \n\nExample: title has an error, but the entry is of type Misc and only requires a bibtex key. \n =||= Fixed in f9ea1d1fe1dd5d01457fecfabbfe522da9e4cfd3\n =||= "], ["151", "Upgraded to windows 10: Bibsonomy plug-in failure", null, "ideutsch", "09/10/15, 07:05:14 AM", "I upgraded my OS from Windows 7 to Windows 10 recently, and the JabRef does not allow me to add new entries or even edit existing entries.

I really dislike the inconsistency between them: `UTF8` has no `-`, but `UTF-16` has: Both should have a dash resulting in `UTF-8`. (see https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8)\n-  `Cp1251` should be `CP1251` (see http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/cp1251.7.html for example).

Similar for all other encodings\n\nOn the one hand, I am very well aware that a change here results in a large compatibility code where the old strings have to be mapped to the new strings. On the other hand, I would like to see JabRef having strings not causing confusion.\n\nRelated: #118, #131 ", "I fully agree with what you write and just had a look at this issue.\n\nAs far as I can see, we can just replace the faulty names with the correct ones in `ALL_ENCODINGS` and add the correct names to `ENCODING_NAMES_LOOKUP`. This means we have two keys (the correct name and the old name) for the same encoding. This should not break anything, since `ALL_ENCODINGS` is only used to display available encoding names in the UI and `ENCODING_NAMES_LOOKUP` is used for for actually applying an encoding. Hence, duplicate keys won't hurt as long as the values are ok (which, I assume, they are).\n\nTo sum up: This change looks pretty easy to me, but perhaps I just overlooked a difficult problem.

Did we change the resolution of these strings from b3 to b4? I don't know if we need these strings in `JabRef_*.properties` at all. I would vote for removing them completely there.\n\nExcerpt of result of `grep -r \"Save_selected_as\" .` in `jabref-dev_2.11/src/main/resources/resource`\n\n```\n./JabRef_pt_BR.properties:Save_selected_as_...=Salvar_selecionados_como...\n./JabRef_pt_BR.properties:Save_selected_as_plain_BibTeX_...=Salvar_selecionado_como_Bibtex_simples\n./Menu_pt_BR.properties:Save_selected_as_...=Salvar_os_se&lecionados_como...\n```\n\nI can do the merging into the master branch and resolving the conflicts...\n\n(Pro hint: [have two checkouts at the same time](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree))\n =||= The displayed menu text is not translated in 2.11b3 as there is no \"Save_selected_as_plain_BibTeX_...\" key in the `Menu_*.properties`. \nThe key is present in the `JabRef_*.properties` and this key is used to translate the tooltip popping up when hovering over the menu title. \n\n(This is one weak point in the current localization: there are various strings which have to be maintained in two places:  `Menu_*.properties` and `JabRef_*.properties`)\n\nBut I have not seen, that the exactly same key is used for both translations so I will simply copy the ones from `JabRef_*.properties` to  `Menu_*.properties` (both in `master` and `dev_2.11`).\n =||= Would it make sense to have only a single properties file for all of the translations?\n =||= Generally yes. \n\nTwo drawbacks: \n1) For new translators a relatively small `Menu_XX.properties` files is a good starting point and not so daunting as the 2500+ lines `JabRef_xx.properties`.\n2) Although the Strings for Menu and JabRef are almost equal, there is some special handling of Menu Strings as they might contain `&` for indicating Mnemonic keys. So there must be a solution to display the values correctly for menu and \"normal\" usage.\n =||= I agree with @matthiasgeiger and I can add more on this:\nI do not think this is advisable for very practical reasons: when a new potential translator shows up, the menu_XX.properties is relatively short, you can easily see the results, and you get all the menus translated in the short term. So, it is an easy task, and you get rewarded soon. For motivation, this is a clear plus.\nIf we merge menu_XX.properties and JabRef_XX.properties, I am afraid it will discourage most candidates, and also it will be difficult to start by translating all the menu.\nIf there is a need to merge both files, I guess the option is to identify the strings related to the menus (for example, \"Save_as...=Save_as...\" could be changed into \"MenuJabref_Save_as...=Save_as...\"), so that we can tell translators \"OK, the file is quite large, but do not be afraid: if you only do the strings starting with MenuJabref, it will be an easy and significant step forward.\n =||= Ok, then we should keep it as it is. \n =||= @koppor This can be closed as you merged the translations back to master in 88a5cc3706e03f50977aae17515660cec247abb8?\n =||= "], ["160", "Support of different type of BibTeX files", "Oliver Kopp", "koppor", "05/26/16, 06:49:31 AM", "We need two types of BibTeX files: One for collecting (BC) and one for working in tex files (BW).\n\nBC: This file is UTF-8 without encoded umlauts, without additional braces.\n\nBW: This file should have all characters encoded using LaTeX directives and containing only the fields required by the publisher. E.g., no review field, series only in the short form, abbreviated journal name, no DOI, ...

That effort should be reduced by JabRef.", "I think JabRef should keep working with the maximally informative format (BC) to retain as much information as possible for storage. Ideally I think it is the responsibility of the style file to get rid of any unwanted fields. UTF is not necessarily a problem either, if using bibtex8 or Biblatex.

So in this case, no (BW) file is necessary at all. For the bibtex users, I would suggest the following workflow (which needs some additional features in JabRef):\n1. Run latex on your document.\n2. Create a new (BW) file based on (BC) and the aux-file. (Not implemented in JabRef I think)\n3. Run a cleanup on the new (BW) file.

The cleanup operations have been improved in the meanwhile so that it is relatively easy to convert a BC file to a BW one. Moreover, the consensus above was that JabRef should focus on supporting the BC format.\n =||= I'd rather like to put it \"on-hold\", as sometimes one wants to have complete entries with volume and series, which one doesn't want in the final bib file.

(Except the clean commit history )\n\nThe changes include:\n- Search bar is now at the top\n- Autocompletion suggestions are shown in a popup\n- Search options are available via a drop-down list, this implements Feature Request #853\n- \"Clear search\" button also clears search field, this implements Feature Request #601\n- In incremental search mode: next result is selected by pressing enter (instead of Control + F as previously)\n- Incremental search now uses the same search engine as the other search modes\n- Added a new search mode (Live filter) which filters the table as soon as the search text is changed\n\nI have a few questions:\n- ~~There are quite a few changes from formatting the code in Eclipse. Is it ok if I include them?~~\n- I have a problem with listening to changes in the textfield and programatically setting the text with setText(). The latter command triggers first an event for the deletion of the text and then another one for inserting the new one. Is there a way to be informed just once about such a change? (This occours in the following case: if the user accepts an autocompletion, then the text is changed via setText(). Thus, in incremental and live filter mode, two searches are performed.)\n- ~~The SearchWorker implemented the AbstractWorker interface. As far as I understood, this enables one to do work asynchronously and then change the GUI later. However, the worker is simply run via \n      worker.getWorker().run();\n      worker.getCallBack().update();\n  In my understanding, this defeats completely the purpose of using the AbstractWorker. What is the right way to run it?~~\n- ~~A general observation about the `SearchRule` class. Every method of it takes the query as an argument. I would propose to save the query internally in  `SearchRule` and thus simplify the interface a little bit.~~\n- ~~The setting \"Autocomplete names\" is not yet implemented. In my opinion this can be completely removed.~~\n- ~~The setting \"Select matches\" is not yet implemented since I do not understand the purpose of this setting. Should it control whatever the first match is selected after the search is performed? Moreover, I think it was not implemented in the old search pane.~~\n\nThings which should be done at some point (I will open a ticket after this pull request was accepted):\n- All the other inline autocompletions (in fields for example) should also use the new dropdown style autocompleter\n- Search result table is not styled the same as main table, related [SF Bug 847](http://sourceforge.net/p/jabref/bugs/847/)", "Regarding new eclipse formatting rules: for me it is very hard to review the patch because there are too many lines that have been changed because of the change in formatting rules. This makes it very hard to determine which lines do actually have changed. I would propose that eclipse formatter changes should be done in isolation in separate pull requests. \n =||= I completely understand this. Now there is a second pull request #166 just containing the format/cleanup changes. Is this enough to make comparison easier or should I somehow also modify this PR?\n =||= The thing is that when I want to know what happened in a pull request, I look at https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/162/files which in this case is +2000 lines and -2000 lines at the moment. A lot of these lines were just reformatted, e.g., all the changes in the SearchManagerNoGUI. When the PR is small, formatting changes are no problem, but in this case it would help if this PR would only contain the functional changes, if this is possible without reprogramming everything. \n\nRegarding the thing with the AbstractWorker and the run/update method. This is correct as it is because in the constructor of the AbstractWorker a bit of MAGIC (it is really a lot of magic) happens so that when you invoke the run method, it will run ouside the Swing EDT and the update method will run inside the Swing EDT. \n\nRegarding the SearchRule: At the moment the search rule can be configured during its constructor and then invoked with different queries to allow reuse of the configuration done by the user in the GUI. At the moment the configuration mainly consists of [bool caseSensitive, bool regex]. But this model does not fit that well. I think it would be a good idea to just create test Predicates that receive a BibtexEntry and they can determine whether it will be included in the search or not. \n\nI think we can delete \"Select matches\". I do not see any usefulness in this setting, especially as it has not yet been implemented. \n\n\"Autocomplete Names\" does work on my machine. We should not remove it. \n =||= We do not want to loose all the work you did. Can you rebase on master? I will try to have a look at all the changes. \n\nAnother remark: why not make the live option the only one search mode and removing the explicit search button? For me, this is the typical search behavior in most of the applications I know. Even windows search. \n =||= I will try to rebase on master at the weekend.\nWhat should I do with the settings \"Autocomplete names\" and \"Select matches\" (see above)?\n =||= The rebase run into problems since some files were moved (for example BasePanel.java).

Then do a new commit. I hope that this commit has clean changes and is readable. Then you can do a `git push -f origin:uisearch` to overwrite the `uisearch` branch with the clean commits. Would that be possible? Then you can also reset your original branch to the new origin/uisearch. If something goes wrong, you still have a copy locally where you can compare using [KDiff3](http://kdiff3.sourceforge.net/) etc. (For the record, there are [many good diff tools](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/572237/whats-the-best-three-way-merge-tool)).\n =||= @matthiasgeiger and myself checked the new search UI and we liked it. Especially the live feature! :)\n\nWe are currently discussing to simplify the search altogether in #104. Maybe we can combine a few things. May be you can have a look at this issue as well and we can work something out for integrate these ideas in your PR as well. \n =||= @koppor I opened a second, cleaner PR #307 (I don't want to override my branch). I hope this is also ok.\n\n@simonharrer I had a look on the discussion in #104 while implementing this PR. Indeed, some of the design decision were strongly influenced by this thread. On the other hand, some of the motivations for the suggested changes in #104 do no longer apply to the search control at the top of the window (in contrast to the previous implementation as a side control). For example, the size of the dropdown showing the different search options is not very important so that is now no problem to show all the search options as a list.\nTo be honest, I would prefer if you could accept this PR and we discuss further improvements later.

I've forked to my GitHub-account, got a copy of that on to my laptop but the reverse process may take a bit more time to figure out... :-)\n\nAnyway, I've improved this a bit, with more words that shouldn't be capitalized, but the problem is that there isn't a single way to write title case. Especially, some publishers (APA and IEEE at least) capitalize all words with more than three characters (basically, I guess, to avoid the confusion that some words are sometimes prepositions, which shouldn't be capitalized, sometimes major words, which should). How do you recon we should go about with that? Have two different TitleCaseChangers?\n\nIn addition, I made sure that words within curly brackets are kept as is for all CaseChangers.\n\nThe things that remain are making sure that the first word after \":\" is capitalized and that both parts of a hyphenated word is capitalized (such as \"First-Time GitHub-User\").\n =||= Great!\n[Here is a link to the official GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/proposing-changes-to-a-project-with-pull-requests/) regarding \"Pull-Requests\" which is the standard GitHub way to contribute to JabRef after you have pushed the changes to your fork. \nWe will review your work and can than merge it into the project codebase.\nIf you should have any questions or trouble just contact us!\n =||= The other page is https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/ (which is also in our CONTRIBUTING.md).

Replacing a default abbreviation with a personal one should not result in a duplicate warning. Is this what you mean?\n =||= Not exactly. I find that if you create a new abbreviation, not present in the default list, the program warns about a duplicate.\nIn the example above I created an abbreviation for the fake journal \"Test Journal of Motorcycle Repair\", which is **not** in the default list, but only in the personal list. JabRef then warns that it's a duplicate:\n\n```\nDuplicate Journal Abbreviation - old one will be overwritten by new one\nOLD: Abbreviation{name=Test Journal of Motorcycle Repair, iso=Test J. Mot. Rep., medline=Test J Mot Rep}\nNEW: Abbreviation{name=Test Journal of Motorcycle Repair, iso=Test J. Mot.

So, in that case the warnings make sense.\n =||= I have implemented a fix for the first part of the issue. For the second part, I do not know what to do. Maybe we should change the log statements to debug so that they are not shown to the user?\n =||= An option might be to extract the IEEE journals abbreviations from journalList.txt and creating a third list with the \"plain\" IEEE journals abbreviations. Then if USE_IEEE_ABRV is **not** set the \"plain\" list is loaded, otherwise the \"LaTeX abbreviations\" in IEEEJournalList.txt is loaded (and a single line warning is sent to output).\nWill this also speed up the startup avoiding the duplicate check?\n =||= Good thinking. This might be an easy way to solve these issues while speeding up startup time. Especially not having all this console output will speed up the start as this is an expensive IO action. The check itself should be very fast and not that problematic.\n =||= Any comments from your side, @ambro2 ? Otherwise I will close this issue. \n =||= I haven't had any chance to test the branch.

When users with different configuration options check in their `.bib` file into version control, the files have textual diffeences without any content difference.\n\nI propose that JabRef writes its serialization settings into the bibtex file at each save. This ensures that the serialization options are always met. The other option is that JabRef asks the user whether he wants to prepare the `.bib` file for sharing. If not, JabRef stores the filename in its preferences and never asks the user again.\n\nThis covers at least\n- entry sorting (alphabetically using the author, sorting by the bibtex key, or no sorting, just adding entries at the end)\n- format of each entry (see #116)\n## Related discussions\n- This issue is closely related to the discussion going on at #116 - especially https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/116#issuecomment-133311604.\n- https://sourceforge.net/p/jabref/feature-requests/892/\n- https://sourceforge.net/p/jabref/feature-requests/854/", "But then the file contains text that is not bibtex and probably not in bibtex syntax.

Currently, there are three different styles for ordering the serialization. If your preferences differ between your machines, maybe different styles are selected, resulting in a different output. Did you recently reset preferences?\n\nAs things stand, this is no bug or issue, but the design of jabref. I am very much for using only one serialization format and disallowing customizations, which would fix all this. But from what I can tell, customization is desired.\n =||= I was only referring to the contents _within_ `jabref-entrytype: Collection: opt`. I went through the code and couldn't see any change of the ordering of the optional fields. This also cannot be configured, therefore I doubt, it has anything to do with the reset of my preferences (#132).\n\nDid not want to open a general discussion as #116. :innocent: \n =||= I think, it has to do with different java versions: `Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_60-b27)` seems to order alphabetically, whereas `build 1.8.0_51-b16` seems to reverse the last two.\n =||= What? :frowning:\n =||= @koppor: can you determine which sorting style you use (which of the writing methods get called in BibtexEntryWriter)?\n\nSorting is done via calling [Collection.sort()](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Collections.html#sort-java.util.List-) with a `List<String>`. For some fields it is done via putting them in a [TreeSet](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/TreeSet.html). Regardless of the method, the order should be the same. It is hard to believe that the JVM suddendly sorts Strings from z-a and not from a-z.\n\nSee the following code from BibtexEntryWriter:\n\n``` java\n    private void writeRequiredFieldsFirstOptionalFieldsSecondRemainingFieldsThird(BibtexEntry entry, Writer out) throws IOException {\n        // Write header with type and bibtex-key.\n        out.write('@' + entry.getType().getName() + '{');\n\n        HashSet<String> writtenFields = new HashSet<>();\n\n        writeKeyField(entry, out);\n        writtenFields.add(BibtexEntry.KEY_FIELD);\n\n        // Write required fields first.\n        // Thereby, write the title field first.\n        boolean hasWritten = writeField(entry, out, \"title\", false);\n        writtenFields.add(\"title\");\n\n        if (entry.getRequiredFields() != null) {\n            List<String> requiredFields = getRequiredFieldsSorted(entry);\n            for (String value : requiredFields) {\n                if (!writtenFields.contains(value)) { // If field appears both in req. and opt. don't repeat.\n                    hasWritten = hasWritten | writeField(entry, out, value, hasWritten);\n                    writtenFields.add(value);\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\n        // Then optional fields\n        if (entry.getOptionalFields() != null) {\n            List<String> optionalFields = getOptionalFieldsSorted(entry);\n            for (String value : optionalFields) {\n                if (!writtenFields.contains(value)) { // If field appears both in req. and opt. don't repeat.\n                    hasWritten = hasWritten | writeField(entry, out, value, hasWritten);\n                    writtenFields.add(value);\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\n        // Then write remaining fields in alphabetic order.\n        TreeSet<String> remainingFields = new TreeSet<>();\n        for (String key : entry.getAllFields()) {\n            boolean writeIt = write ?

Thus, it stabilized and the issue can be closed.\n\nMinor remark: The file has been recognized as BibLaTeX even though with the `@comment` it should have been BibTeX. I had to insert `@Comment{jabref-meta: DATABASE_TYPE:BibTeX;}` manually and reopen the file in JabRef to be able to investigate that behavior. - Don't know, how to deal with it, but since no one complains, it's also OK for me.\n =||= @koppor I encounters this issue when I open a bibtex file in JabRef v2.7.1, v2.10 and the latest v3.6.

After playing around with Unirest (and org.json), it appears as rather straightforward to implement this without POJOs.

Is it a waste of time to do a DOAJ import based on \"manual\" conversion from bibjson to BibtexEntry? Of course, I'll use the Json functions, but rather checking specific fields rather than mapping it to POJOs.\n\nA small problem here is that it appears as if the author order is not always correct/consistent. Also, the author formatting differs between journals, but still I guess it is better than manual import. :-)\n =||= Fine with me. I also like working on the JSON more. Could be a nightmare at testing though... Having a POJO model, we can separate the parser JSON -> POJO from the interpretation POJO -> BibTeX. Tests JSON -> BibTeX are also fine.

These two methods should be grouped together in a separate class as all other methods have nothing to do with them.\n- you need to be aware that the OpenOfficePanel also implements the PushToApplication interface. And this class is large (> 1000 LoC). \n =||= - Not sure if I fully understand the first bullet.\n- Yes.

Makes sense. The reason I choose my approach was to always get some output in the status line. In your approach, there will \"only\" be a dialog in some cases. Not that it matters, so I'm happy to go with your approach.\n =||= Just for completeness: in your approach there may have been the case that at least one output may be shown (couldNotConnect could \"fire\" twice, once in the subclass and then in the superclass) whereas in my approach, exactly one output will be shown. \n =||= Sort of. I admit that there could be some guidelines how to write a new PushToXXX (I was thinking about that). From my perspective (/in my version), the only reason for a class to have its own  `operationCompleted` is that it wants to do something else than just showing something in the status bar. So depending on what you want to obtain:\n- Change status bar message\n  - Use getCouldNotCall etc, no need for a new operationComplete\n- Show a dialog\n  - Use operationComplete, but the status bar will still be changed without the need for replicating that part of the code\n\nNow, one can question if it is worthwhile to both show a dialog and change the status bar. It may be that one would like to a have a more uniform behavior for the (simple) PushToXXX (the OpenOffice one kept out of the discussion). Now, some just executes the command and if the system does not return an exception it \"worked\", others parse the result (or rather see if the call did return some text). Some show a dialog, some just a status bar message. Making this more uniform would change the design a bit. But I wasn't comfortable in deciding on the actual behavior of the classes (in a major way).\n =||= Okay, now I get it. \n\nNevertheless, I would make it simpler first with lesser methods.

Usecase: An entry which isn't a duplicate.\n =||= Hm, would it make sense to integrate the dialog for merging entries with the duplication search?\n =||= Not sure if I fully understand the idea. At the moment you either know that you want to merge two entries (or import data from DOI for a single entry) and get the MergeEntryDialog or you rely on the duplication detection and get the DuplicateResolverDialog. I'm not sure that you always want to merge entries, so sometimes it is quicker just to drop one of them.\n =||= Okay. Last remark: what about removing the short form and the complete record tab? The merged entry tab shows all the relevant information including a simplistic form of highlighting the differences per field while both other tabs do not (in this case one has to find the differences without guidance). \n =||= To me that makes sense, but let us hear any possible objections before I\nremove the old stuff. I rarely use duplicate detection anyway and so far\nmainly merge by hand.\n\nOne may think of an additional button in the MergeEntries panel for giving\npriority, i.e. \"clicking\" all radio buttons on that side, to either the\nleft or the right entry in a single click (now the left entry has priority).\n\n(Configurable in preferences? ;-))\n\n(I also see a quite general problem here in my PRs. I mainly add\nfunctionality rather than rethinking the design.)\n =||= Please, no additional preferences. ;) We try to keep this set as small as possible.\n\nI was thinking to have the Keep left/Keep right buttons still. \n\nBut we could still add two buttons for the merge entries to select all left or all right elements. Maybe make the left/right label into a clickable button?\n =||= :+1: for only \"merged entry\" without any additional tabs.\n\n:+1: for replacing \"Keep entry 1\" and \"Keep entry 2\" by buttons nearby \"Use ... Left\" and \"Use ... Right\". Maybe a radio button directly below \"Left\" and one radio button directly below \"Right\".\n =||= I would keep the buttons for keep left\\right. Because it saves the user a\nclick.\n =||= The idea was not to remove any buttons, just add the \"preference button\". I do not think a radio button conceptually makes sense there, but a regular button to select all left/right radio buttons (and add any missing fields from the other entry) for later editing.\n\nThe \"entry 1\"/\"entry 2\" problem is solved naturally with only this \"tab\" as left/right now makes much more sense.\n\nRelated question: when invoked from the ImportInspectionDialog, it states (approx)  \"In database\"/\"From import\". Would it make sense to keep some sort of similar behavior? (I think it does.)\n\n@koppor Regarding your \"Skip\" button. The \"Keep both\" button does the same thing now.\n\nGood thing: The DuplicateResolverDialog will disappear and only the MergeEntriesDialog will remain.\n =||= Draft version without tabs and possibly correct naming of headings and buttons. Still a separate file though (realized that was by far the easiest).\n\nStill to do:\n- [x] get rid of mainLoop\n- [x] postpone the entry removal\n- [ ] add left/right buttons (for preferring fields from left or right entry)\n =||= Looking at the code there is a preference to use the ImportInspectionDialog or not when importing from a file (first lines in the General preference tab). Any objections against always using the  ImportInspectionDialog? The alternative (if not checking this in the preferences) is to import them directly, but trigger the DuplicateResolvingDialog for every duplicate, which is a bit more tedious for the user.\n\nBenefits: 2/3 preference items removed. 100+ lines of code removed.\n =||= Hm, hard to decide. I never use the import feature at all. \n =||= I spent some more time thinking about it (the latest commit contains the result) and I think it makes sense. The alternative behavior can still be obtained by just clicking OK in the ImportInspectionDialog and then run duplicate detection.\n\nThe most likely use case I guess is to merge the contents of two .bib-files and there it should be more manageable to see the overview provided in the the ImportInspectionDialog instead of ending up in an indefinite (or at least hard to predict the length of) sequence of duplicate detections. And as said above, no actual functionality is lost, the alternative way just require one click and one menu selection.\n\nIt did solve two of the problems listed as well as removed duplicated code.\n =||= Sounds reasonable. Good job!\n\nI just tried the \"find duplicate\" feature on your branch: the window is always quite small. When I increase the window size for the first duplication pair, it will be shrinked to the default size for the next duplication pair. This is a little bit annoying.\n =||= I agree. I'll see if I can find some suitable code to copy...\n =||= for me this looks ready to be merged. \n =||= I think the only missing thing that we have discussed (as far as I recall)\nis to provide a way to simply select all left or right radio buttons.\nDidn't really have the focus to sort it out (in a nice looking way) and may\nnot be really required to merge at this stage.\n =||= @oscargus Sure.

It was introduced to be consistent in UIs provided by other software. The compact rank was intended for users not wanting to waste screen space. Regarding the modern screens, I would even favor the non-compact rank. However, the information density per centimeter on the screen might not be as high as the one perceived at the neighboring columns.\n\nWhen not sorting according to the rank (but to the author, title, year, ...), the difference between the different count of stars is difficult to distinguish. I didn't quickly find a reference for that. Meaning: How distinguishable should icons be and how to measure whether a chosen icon is different enough from another icon. I am aware of the [work of Moody regarding notations](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TSE.2009.67), but I couldn't find general work on user interface design. @SamyStyle, maybe you can comment on that?\n\n![Songbird Screen with Stars](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/Songbird_2.0.0_%28Windows_7%29.png)\n =||= I agree, that the implementation in the screenshot looks good, is easy to use and to understand. \nHowever, the current \"non-compact\" icons are just ugly - and as you said it is very hard to distinguish whether a paper is rated with 3, 4 oder 5 stars. \n\nTherefore, if no one implements the behavior as shown above, I vote for removing the \"non-compact\" version and use the compact ranks as default (as done in this PR).\n =||= While probably not allowed to formally vote, I agree that the PR should be merged. Implementing a non-compact rank could be done at a later stage and should preferably also support changing the rank by clicking in the column as well.\n\nThinking about the discussions about using JabRef on high resolution screens, it appears that density is not always a problem. Still, an ugly UI still it, which I believe the current non-compact is. Better to remove and possibly re-introduce in a better way later. \n =||= One can already change the rank by clicking on the column. Both left click (directly change) and right click (context menu offering to change the rank).\n\nI fully agree that having both options is an option overload only necessary for some edge cases. In case I discover good icons for the extended rank, I will bring them back in and adapt `ImportInspectionDialog` and `MainTable` accordingly. Hope, that no one will object if the stars take more space than the other columns.\n =||= I am against having both options. Either compact or non-compact, but the user should not have a choice here. We already have too many preferences for the user, making it difficult for us developers to maintain the code.\n =||= Yes. If it is was not clear, this is also my opinion. \n\nBut I like the proposal of Olly as an replacement for the current \"compact rank\" solution.\n =||= I was rather thinking of having two different column types to select from (still the same entry in the .bib-item, no idea how the table column system works though). Will at least solve the preference problem and hopefully the ugliness problem. (Yes, people may use both in the same table layout, but let them... I can even imagine a quite good use case there.)\n\nHowever, no strong opinion on this as I never use the ranking, in JabRef or in any music organizer, anyway. But I would see a potential drawback in not being able to left-click to change the ranking in the same simple way as a multi-star approach if I used it. I imagine...\n =||= I think two column types are even more ugly to implement in comparison to having a switch in the rendering. :disappointed:\n\nOh, you mean that a star should be directly clickable to select the ranking.

I don't want to have to edit the file manually to create the Month field.", "Hi @foleyj2,\n\nJabRef 2.9.2 is quite outdated. Recently, there have been a few changes to field formatting that might have an impact on your problem. Can you please try out the [current development version](https://circle-artifacts.com/gh/JabRef/jabref/953/artifacts/0/home/ubuntu/jabref/build/releases/JabRef-2.80dev--snapshot--2015-10-26--master--10822a6.jar) and check if your problem persists?\n\nAlso, do I understand you correctly that you expect the serialization to be like\n\n```\nMonth = mar,\n```\n\ninstead of\n\n```\nMonth = {mar},\n```\n\n?\n\nThe first one will definitly _not_ be supported by JabRef.\n =||= If you write\n\n```\nMonth = {mar},\n```\n\nBibTeX understands that 'mar' is the string you want to be actually used for the month.\n\nWhile\n\n```\nMonth = mar,\n```\n\nis a BibTeX standard to abbreviate months (mar for March, apr for April, etc.). Depending on the bibliography style, it can be converted automatically to March (in English), Mars (in French), M\u00e4rz (in German), etc.\nAs such, I believe both have to be supported. And in JabRef 2.10, both are.\n\nBTW, the month abbreviation does not need to be defined by the user with an @STRING .\n\nAt this point, you may start hating BibTeX format... or find it beautiful! ;-)\n =||= As far as I remember someone introduced some autocorrection functionality that automatically wraps non-wrapped fields in brackets. This might be a problem here, but I don't know.\n\nI also believe that Bibtex should be supported in its standard fashion and I believe that people who want a certain feature (full Bibtex support) should be willing to implement it themselves and submit a pull request ;-)\n\nP.S.: In other circumstances, we kind of already decided against full Bibtex support, see #214\n =||= Regarding  #214 (i.e. using \"\" or {}), this is two ways of writing the same thing: this does not change the meaning for bibTeX, leading to the same compilation output. It is different here, about abbreviations.\n\nMore generally, when a user defines an abbreviation using a @string (in the preamble), the related field values will not be between brackets (or double quotes). Enforcing brackets everywhere means that user-defined abbreviations will not work anymore, right?\n =||= When I tried BibLaTeX, I think, it said that numbers should be used (`month = {5}`) instead of strings. That worked quite well for me.\n =||= @mlep: Still, someone might complain that his favourite IDE, tool, whatever can only work with `\"`. But anyways, you are right. At the moment, I am not at all sure how `@string` fields are actually written. And I am also not sure how the bracketing logic inside our write logic works. The code is simply just too weird. Still, this behavior is something we should keep in mind _if_ we decide to re-write the serialization logic. Is there any similar field that I am not aware of or is it just `month`?\n =||= I only know about using `#key#`. For instance, IEEE journal abbreviations are defined in that way  `#journal_abbrev#` in the official IEEE journal abbreviations. \n =||= @simonharrer: Yes, with this knowledge in mind, the writing logic starts making a little more sense. I also found the following comment (but cannot guarantee that the code actually does this):\n\n```\n        // Here we assume that the user encloses any bibtex strings in #, e.g.:\n        // #jan# - #feb#\n        // ...which will be written to the file like this:\n        // jan # { - } # feb\n```\n\nSo it seems that \n\n```\nmonth = #jan#\n```\n\nshould also work?\n =||= > So it seems that\n> \n> `month = #jan#`\n> \n> should also work?\n\nNot exactly. In JabRef the content of the field \"Month\" must be `#mar#` which will then be serialized to:\n`Month = mar,`\nwhich is exactly what you would like to have @foleyj2, isn't it?\n =||= Yes, the solution is indeed to write `#may#`etc. Cleanup Entries will replace `jan/january/jan.` etc with `#jan#` and so on if told to do so, with later versions being much more liberal in how to interpret the month.\n =||= I have not tried the #mon# method, but I tried the previously mentioned putting the number instead and that seems to have worked nicely.

Storing each time resizing is completed using a ComponentAdapter or only if the dialog is closed using a Button?\n =||= Vote for using a ComponentAdapter. Is cleaner, and independent on adding new buttons. \n\nAnother issue I have with this PR: there is no constant for the JabrefPreferences as they are computed by String concatenation. Previously, we tried hard to have constants for every JabrefPreference consolidated in the JabrefPreferences class. This has advantages that we can easily find all available preferences in the system in a single class. I think we should keep that. Because of this, I would suggest that instead of a single string, we pass the four preferences keys that were previously computed to the new positioning class. \n =||= I agree that the ComponentAdapter has some advantages. However, a (major) disadvantage is that it is a bit too much to grasp for me at the moment. :-)\n\nRegarding the preferences, I also agree. It is indeed a bit of a hack, but with the current preference structure, this solution seemed simpler if nothing else. This one I should be able to fix though.\n =||= Component adapter should work this way\n\n``` java\nthis.addComponentListener(new ComponentAdapter() {\n\n            @Override\n            public void componentResized(ComponentEvent e) {\n                // store new infos\n            }\n\n            @Override\n            public void componentMoved(ComponentEvent e) {\n                // store new infos\n            }\n\n        });\n```\n\nThen, this is only stored when the window size is changed or the window is moved. Maybe we could also override the `isShown` method and only then set the size of the window. Then, every time the size/position is read or written would be within this adapter - preventing that the code is scattered around in the corresponding frame/window class. \n\nFrom an architectoral view, I would recommand making the PositionWindow class non-static with the four final fields for the four preferences. This way, we could create an instance of the PositionWindow class for each of the four frames which is then reused in the appropriate places. \n =||= I would not move `GUIGlobals` to the `util` package because it basically hides this important class which is used by almost every GUI class. \n =||= OK!

The only thing I am unsure about is turning various methods static (see above). Can you explain the rationale behind this? Why is static needed here?\n =||= The `static` conversion is because Eclipse warns if methods could be made static. On the one hand, we could add `@suppresswarning` if we are sure that Eclipse is wrong. On the other hand, we could just turn off the `static` warning. I don't have strong a opinion about that. I currently lean towards making methods static if possible to show that they don't access instance variables.\n =||= As @koppor correctly pointed out, this is based on Eclipse warnings and\nEclipse warnings only. I've trusted it so far, but recently I've noted that\nsome warnings disappear when I fix other, to me seemingly unrelated,\nwarnings, so maybe I should read up a bit...\n =||= I tend to disagree with the warning and would prefer non-static versions. The problem with the use of static is that it leads to a higher degree of coupling within the system. Every user of a static method uses the very same instance (that is, the class) and this transitively couples two users although there might be no need for it. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the code works with both versions. Especially if the class is instantiated only once, as is the case in the above line I commented at, there is no difference execution-wise. It is merely a \"design smell\". I have the opinion that a design with a lot of use of static is \"worse\" than a more object-oriented design. If we consistently favor static over non-static, we end up with a purely imperative program, which means we are propably using the wrong programming language.\n\n@JabRef/developers This is about a coding guideline and concerns everyone. So what are the opinions of the remaining people? Should we consistently fix the Eclipse warning regarding the use of static, or should we turn it off?\n =||= OK, I've read up and see the point. I'd say that maybe one should go through all the static methods and remove the static keyword and add warning removal in case it does not make sense to access the method in a static way.\n\nFor reference: I've done this in the earlier cleanups as well, so it may be better to go over it once and for all (although I can of course start by changing these ones back).\n =||= I agree with @lenhard - we should try to reduce the usage of `static` methods and not introduce new ones. \nQuick rule of thumb: \n\n> Static is sensible in Utility classes which provide independent small methods, e.g, `getIntValue(...)`. Static should be avoided in more complex \"logic classes\" - even if only static or no members are accessed. \n\nObjections? @lenhard \n\nI don't like `@suppressWarnings` annotations - so would either turn off this warning completely - or just ignore those warnings \"manually\", i.e., think about it and decide whether the usage is okay or not.\n =||= @matthiasgeiger full ack :+1: \n =||= Could you review eb441846817b11 and efce4ec2eae5bd79e30 (unrelated, but I think, it's important, too)\n =||= @koppor Looks got to me. I imported the project into Eclipse and am not getting the warning at the above position. I also agree with you on the usage of \"this\": it should not be mandatory.\n\nHowever, I found another Eclipse warning, we should be aware of here. In the following line\n\n``` java\nnew FocusRequester(((BasePanel) JabRef.jrf.tabbedPane.getComponentAt(0)).mainTable);\n```\n\nEclipse warns that `The allocated object is never used`. The warning is a false positive. `FocusRequester` starts itself in a separate Thread in its constructor (which is unsafe publication and a potential bug, but that is a different issue) and it does not matter that it is not used at this position. I don't think we should ignore the `unused` warning, but _we should not blindly delete every variable for which it occurs_. Instead, we should add a `@SuppressWarnings(\"unused\")`, if it is a false positive.\n =||= I have removed the statics introduced in this PR.\n =||= Rebased on current master so it should be possible to merge this (unless any other issues arise).\n =||= Huh.... requires quite some time to scroll through all your changes :wink:\n\nAs you can see above I had a few remarks. \n\nApart from those: Good job!

One example:\nIn [BasePanel.java l. 1442](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/301/files#diff-92a266d65712209292ed1665e6bc2930R1442) the content of a `SaveException.java` is shown to the user in a MessageDialog. As the exception message was localized during creation (see for example [SaveException.java before your changes](https://github.com/oscargus/jabref/commit/c960b0afe11d34493878697a4a64c09c632914c1#diff-f513641de787eb1fe90118425120a4efL28)) the message was completely localized.\nAfter your changes the `ex.getMessage()` part is always English.\n\n@JabRef/developers I'm not sure what we should do here. Generally, I would propose: No localization at Exception instantiation - localization at the time a localized string is actually needed. \nHowever, this would result in calls like `Localization.lang(ex.getMessage())` which cannot be tracked by the Python script tracking all used/unused translation keys. \nLocalizing only those exception message which are used somewhere else is also grap: Hard to find to out and even harder to ensure during the evolution of the code.\nIf we stay at the status quo: We have (potentially) bloated translation file which contains lots of keys which are shown never to the user (except he looks in the error console) and which may be harder for us the debug if a Japanese stack trace is pasted here. \n =||= Good point. \n\nHow often is the message of an exception displayed to the user in a translated way?\n\nIn principal, I prefer to translate at the latest point in time. Maybe instead of calling Localization.lang(ex.getMessage()) one could check the message and depending on its content return a specific translation. Something like\n\n``` java\nif(\"asdf asdfas\".equals(ex.getMessage())) {\n  return Localization.lang(\"super user-friendly text\");\n}\n```\n =||= > How often is the message of an exception displayed to the user in a translated way?\n\nCan't tell you. Analyzing this requires some time (SaveExceptions are shown only at one position (see above) - but created at 11 different positions in the code).\nAnother problem:\n`throw new SaveException(Localization.lang(\"Save failed while committing changes\") + \": \" + ex2.getMessage());` - where ex2 refers to an `IOException` - your proposal would not work with such cases.\n\nIf a custom exception is shown to the user we might introduce another field \"localizedMessage\" which _can_ be created during instantiation and returned by a getter in the case a localized message is needed for the UI - but of course this does not help if an `Exception e` is caught. :scream_cat: \n =||= I was sort of aware of this, but inspired by a comment from @koppor on my local version of the branch, I decided to still give it a go (I can revert it to the previous version if required).\n\nI note that there is a method getLocalizedMessage() defined, which require that we subclass the Exception. However, if it is primarily SaveException in combination with BasePanel (which I think it is), it might be a viable alternative.\n\nWhat I think @simonharrer meant (or at least a feasible solution) would be to do:\n`throw new SaveException(\"Sfwcc:\" + ex2.getMessage());` and then split based on `':'` or whatever is a good delimiter.\n =||= Please, no parsings with `:`. I would introduce new exceptions (inherit from SaveException) or use properties of SaveException for information of the filename. (Currently, I don't know whether Exceptions offer the possibility to add more information than using the message).\n\nAt the end, I would do `ex instanceof MyCoolException` or do an appropriate `catch` block (the more specific exceptions coming earlier) and inside the catch block outputting the user-friendly-text. Please, no `\"asdf asdfas\".equals(ex.getMessage())`. This is not typesafe and we are working hard to get rid from strings cluttered around the code. (See keybindings, preferences, ...)\n =||= Now, since `SaveException` is a JabRef exception, I plan to add a getLocalizedMessage() and set that with the translated string before throwing the exception. Hence, any dialog use getLocalizedMessage() and any logging getMessage(). OK?\n\nI'll check carefully if there are other Exceptions that use this as well, but my impression is that with SaveException, we cover 90% at least (if not 100%).\n =||= `getlocalizedMessage()` sounds good! :dizzy:\n =||= For the future, please to try create small pull requests. It is hard to scan the changes of more than 300 lines. \n\nFrom my perspective, this PR looks good to be merged. \n =||= I understand that. However, for this type of \"brute-force\" conversion PR, it is hard to keep them small. Shouldn't be that many more though. I've seen some translations that can be improved/replaced (using \"%0\" etc instead of concatenating strings), but this should cover quite a bit of it and most warnings are also removed now.\n\nMoving GUIUtils back removed 15 or so files from the PR anyway. :-) \n =||= I don't have much time to think it through - but I'm not convinced that the current solution regarding the localized messages in exception solves all problems... \n\nI hope I'll find some time this evening to explain my thougths.\n =||= @matthiasgeiger : You are correct. It doesn't solve all problems, but quite a bit of them. There are a handful or so exception messages which are not translated at the moment. However, I have not been able to fully figure out why they are translated (i.e., if there is a reason that they are translated to start with) and where they show up (some are quite obviously translated for a reason though). The way to solve this is to create subclasses of three(?) exception types which support getLocalizedMessage().\n\nSomehow, at the moment, we get to choose between reports of missing translations or bug reports with stack traces in Japanese. ;-)\n\nAlso, looking at the complete translation/logging/error reporting situation, it can be improved. There is still quite a bit of exception handling which just prints the stack trace. I still find strings that should be translated. While most messages to SaveException is translated, it is also quite common that the exception message provided is \"rt\". Quite a few strings are built from concatenation, limiting the grammatical correctness of translations.\n\nI think it would be brilliant if some guidelines for translations could be formed. Now, quite often, the strings doesn't include a full stop (.) nor are variables added with %0 etc. I also think it would be a good idea to make a major overhaul of this is one go, as a translator would benefit quite a bit of having the obsolete translations available when adding new, almost similar, strings.\n =||= Okay got some minutes time... \nYou are right, your last commits are a big step in the right direction. The implementation of `getLocalizedMessage()` in `SaveException` is the right way to solve the issues and this should be adapted to more Exceptions.\n\nBut currently there still will be \"mixed language\" messages in the code as - for example in `FileActions.java` - you are creating localized messages which are relying on the implementation of `getLocalizedMessage()` method in standard API `IOException`s. And I don't think that, e.g., a `FileNotFoundException` does actually provide a localized message.\n\nI have not checked whether the SaveExceptions in `FileActions.java` are only logged or actually displayed in the UI. But as you stated above:\n\n> Hence, any dialog use getLocalizedMessage() and any logging getMessage().\n\nWe would use the getLocalizedMessage() only in dialogs/UI output. Maybe we should not append any technical messages from the cause at all? [An example is in `SaveSession`](https://github.com/oscargus/jabref/commit/1338137cff12a943b9e71888039d4e399bf46cee#diff-5cadfd8a296c63905e55cafd1321851fR130) where an IOException is caught:\n\n``` java\nthrow new SaveException(\"Save failed while committing changes: \" + ex2.getMessage(),\n                Localization.lang(\"Save failed while committing changes: %0\", ex2.getMessage()));\n```\n\nhere it might be sufficient to append the ex2.getMessage() part only to the \"logMessage\" but not to the \"UI message\":\n\n``` java\nthrow new SaveException(\"Save failed while committing changes: \" + ex2.getMessage(),\n                Localization.lang(\"Save failed while committing changes.\"));\n```\n\nHowever, this is only possible if the localized message is specific enough for the user to know what the problem might be... Applying this pattern consistently in whole project would require a huge effort, as the whole exception handling has to be improved: \n- clearer distinction between \"API Exceptions\" and JabRef exceptions we throw on our own\n- replacing the catching and especially throwing of raw `Exception` (and even `Throwable` :scream_cat: )\n- which requires: creating custom Exceptions with an implementation of `getLocalizedMessage()\n- systematic usage of logging instead of System.out/err\n- ...\n\nThis is enough stuff for some more huge PRs :wink:  - and I fear solving this in \"batch-mode\" will not be possible, but it requires quite some thinking time in various cases.\n\n> I think it would be brilliant if some guidelines for translations could be formed. Now, quite often, the strings doesn't include a full stop (.) nor are variables added with %0 etc. I also think it would be a good idea to make a major overhaul of this is one go, as a translator would benefit quite a bit of having the obsolete translations available when adding new, almost similar, strings.\n\n:+1: Full Ack! We should create a Wiki-Page for this - including the guidelines how to deal with localized exceptions :wink: \n =||= Uhh... A few days ago, I just mentioned the existence of a few false positives, and now it seems a big trouble to a whole bunch of programmers... :-/\n\nAnyway, I do not understand much at this very technical discussion.\nShould the \"guidelines how to deal with localized exceptions\" be added to the wiki page regarding translation? (https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/wiki/Translating-JabRef) I guess not...\n =||= Don't worry @mlep you are not the cause of this trouble :wink:\n\nThe main trouble is the rather bad and inconsistent exception handling in the code...\nRegarding the Wiki-documentation: No, this is not relavant for translators - but a guide for programmers how to enable localization in a \"correct\" way. (Still, a cross reference might be useful).\n\nRegarding the PR: I think we can merge the current state as is and improve the Exception handling (and its localization) step-by-step.\n =||= As I understand it getLocalizedMessage() will just return getMessage() if it is not overridden, so it is safe from that perspective.\n\nRegarding appending messages, I think it depends.

I would propose to remove one layer of abstraction using the following idea (would be a new PR):\nCreate a class `CleanupPreset` which collects all the possible formatters / cleanup operations and whatever the operation is activated or not. This class should also contain a method `cleanup(BibtexEntry)` which applies all the active formatters to the `BibtexEntry`. Maybe we also need a factory to create the (default) presets for save / import / export etc. Then on save (or cleanup or whatever) the appropriate preset will be created and then applied to the correct entries. I'm not sure whatever there should be an additional layer (i.e. move the cleanup method from the preset class to some commander) which keeps track of changes and allows them to be reverted.\n =||= I tried to address your large comment with several minor comments inline in the code. I hope you get the idea of what I am aiming for. \n =||= @simonharrer Thanks for your feedback. I refactored the code around formatters and cleanup actions, while keeping your suggestions in mind.

On closer inspection at the line 163 in `CopacImporter.java` (else condition) it becomes clear, that Copac accepts all kind of tags which differ from those listed above. That's probably the reason why the code looks short.

Why not naming `JabRefException` `LocalizedExcpetion` to be closer to the intended usage of the class?\n =||= Since exceptions shouldn't be used to control the flow of control (eg [here](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/189222/are-exceptions-as-control-flow-considered-a-serious-antipattern-if-so-why) or [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/729379/why-not-use-exceptions-as-regular-flow-of-control)) the problem of localizing exceptions shouldn't occur in the first place. As far as I understood, exceptions are there to be reported to us as bugs :). \n\nMy rule of thumb is:\n- Exceptions = where failure is not expected as an option\n- (Boolean) return values = where failure might be an expected result\n\nFor example, the [SaveException](https://github.com/oscargus/jabref/blob/master/src/main/java/net/sf/jabref/exporter/SaveException.java) shouldn't derive from exception. And instead of throwing a SaveException it should be the return value of the save method (and then better renamed to SaveReturnValue). \n\nThis is at least what I'm used from other programming languages / landscapes. \n =||= @tobiasdiez I don't agree. \nThe bottom line of the discussions you linked above is that \"`Exceptions` should not be used to control the **normal** flow\" (e.g. using an `Exception` to leave a loop). \n**But**, `Exceptions` are explicitly allowed and should be used for _exceptional cases_. \n\n_(Sticking stricly to \"do not use exception to control the flow\" paradigm would render_ **_all**_ _checked exceptions obsolete as each handling of checked exceptions steers the control flow in a program...)_\n\nRegarding your example: When a file is saved in JabRef this should work in almost each case - an error during saving is an _exception_, which most often occurs due to an underlying `IOException`. Therefore, it is reasonable to throw an `Exception` to indicate the _exceptional termination_ of a save method.\n\nThe `SaveExceptions` are used at various places in the code: In `void` methods, in methods returning a `SaveSession`, ... - so it is not possible to define one `SaveResult` which is returned from the methods which may produce an error during saving. Even if it would be possible (for example by providing a generic saveMethod which is used throughout the code - you still have to do some \"exception handling\": What if the method returns `false` or a String `\"Saving failed due to an IOException`? The result has to be checked by the method caller and must be handled somehow. If saving was not possible, all the things which rely on a saved file cannot be executed - so you depend on constructs like this:\n\n``` java\nif (saveResult.isSuccess()) { \n  // ... do the work and return something useful\n} else {\n  // return null? \n  // return another \"wrapper object\" containting not the intended result but a flag indicating failure?\n}\n```\n\nAnd this goes all the way through the code back to the origininal call in the UI. \n\nI think using a `throws` declaration at the methods and catching the exception late in the UI is the more appropriate way (especially if you see the \"application logic\" as an isolated part of the system which is used by the UI only through API calls).\n\nAt the end [something to read what shows why I have problems with the current way of exception handling in the JabRef code](https://today.java.net/article/2006/04/04/exception-handling-antipatterns). I think we can find more than one instance of each \"anti pattern\" in our code base :wink:\n\n@koppor This should be the \"root JabRef exception\" replacing the usage of raw `Exception`which must be caught by a `catch (Exception e)` :cry:  It also should be extended by other more specific exceptions such as the  `SaveException`.\nSo the ability to provide a localized message is only one aspect of the `JabRefException`.\n =||= @matthiasgeiger \nOk, you are right in many points. Nonetheless, I think it is not a good idea to directly output exceptions to the user (except for debugging). Exceptions is something for cases where Jabref shouldn't be able to recover from the failure. If the save operation goes wrong, then the code should catch the corresponding exception and write a message to the user. In pseudocode:\n\n```\n    handle(NoSpaceException)\n       show(you have not enough space on your disk to save)\n    handle(FileExistsException)\n       show(there exists already a file with the same name. do you want to overwrite?)\n    handle(OtherException)\n       error(I don't know why the save operation didn't work. please report this bug to the developers)\n```\n\nYes, it is more work then a simple `show(exceptionMessage)` but in my opinion the better way to go. \n =||= We are actually doing exactly this?!\n\nThe SaveException wraps the techncial reason and is thrown to the UI where the non-technical message and the causing `Exception` are logged - and the user is informed by a dialog only showing the non-technical, localized message.\n =||= If there are no objections regarding the concept I'll merge this PR - further improvements can either be made en bloc in another PR or on-the-fly when working on other issues.\n =||= LGTM :+1: \n =||= Hmpf... there was a comment regarding translation in one of the commits which is no longer accessible due to the rebase - However, this is obsolete as Oscar has already changed this in `master`.\n =||= "], ["321", "Endnote importer test", "Christian Bartsch", "chriba", "01/01/16, 02:15:47 PM", "NaN", "Could you add some real EndNote entries?

The recovery should also be done automatically.\n\nReason: There should be less configuration possibilities.

For example, it is relative pointless to save the same data to two files on every change. Thus I would differentiate between the following two cases:\n- auto-save enabled: make a backup copy on opening the file but don't write changes to it. In this way, we have a backup for the old state and the real file always contains the current state.\n- auto-save disabled: create a backup copy when the file is opened and save all changes to it. Only write to the real file if the user presses save. \n\nSo in either case there is a file with the old state and a file with the current state.  \n =||= Implemented in #2118 and help pages prepared (https://github.com/JabRef/help.jabref.org/pull/108).\n =||= Thank you for reporting this issue.

So when one uses different file names, everything stays the same. But for the entries that have the same file names, add parent folders until the name is unique. Should not be too difficult to determine. \n =||= Or a \"display name\" field under database properties where the user can decide about the name.\n =||= We also talked about that solution but this adds another proprietary field that must be saved inside the bib file.\n =||= Is this a big problem? If this additional data in the bib file is inconvenient for the user, then he just don't have to specify a display name. Alternatively, we can save the display name in Jabref's config instead of the file.\n =||= Another drawback is that the name must be set explicitely. This should be an (automatic) help feature to distinguish databases that share the same name, which is (at least for me) often the case when using the same base template.\n =||= @wielanms and me also favour the idea of a display name (see also https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/341#issuecomment-157182168). The initial display name could be derived automatically. Think, there are already solutions used in other software. Using the first two letters of each path element etc. The default can be overwritten by the user. The name could be written in the header of the BibTeX file (and not using `@comment{jabref-meta: ...`).\n\nThe naming scheme by Simon is also interesting. However, the display name will change depending on other files which may be misleading. Therefore, I propose to use `<parent folder name>/<bib file name>` as initial display name.\n =||= Why make the label of the tab long when it is unnecessary? The problem I see is when `bib` files are stored in `bibliography` folders instead of in the root folder directly, which is common in larger tex projects.\n =||= I do not like the idea of a display name...\n\nHow about: \n`filename.bib` iff this label is unique.\n`.../parent/filename.bib` iff this label is unique.\n`.../parent/parent/filename.bib` iff this label is unique\n...\n\nApart from this I think we are already applying the best practices from other tools: Showing the full path of the currently open bib DB in the window title and tool tips with the full path for each tab.\n\nEdit:\nJust have seen this in sublime: \n![sublime-tabs](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/676652/11206118/4a19d388-8d0d-11e5-9214-10e9a8d47c6a.png)\n =||= :+1: for the sublime idea with `$filename [-- $unique-folder-path]`\n =||= :+1:  for implementing the sublime behavior.\n =||= Implemented in #351 \n =||= "], ["350", "Reuse Zotero's translators?", "Tobias Diez", "tobiasdiez", "07/26/16, 07:47:34 AM", "I think the reference manager with the best import functionality is Zotero. Fortunately, their importers are [open-source](https://github.com/zotero/translators). So it seems to be natural to reuse the code for the import into Jabref, right?\n\nOne way would be to set-up a [translation-server](https://github.com/zotero/translation-server) and speak with it via simple (same-machine) http requests as for example [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33282289/using-zotero-translators-to-get-author-affiliation).", "Yes, but as far as I understood it they only support importing to and exporting from the Zotero format. So we would always need to do two steps: import to Zotero and export into Bibtex for a single import functionality. The same when doing an export. \n =||= Yes. First you transform the website into a zotero object (json) and then convert this into bib(la)tex. Actually, this works quite well and is the same strategy I used for [my firefox addon](https://github.com/tobiasdiez/Jabref-FirefoxAddon).\n(I don't understand what you mean with \"same when doing an export\").\n =||= Runs on `zotero.jabref.org:1969`:\n\n```\ncurl -d '{\"url\":\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15424060903167229\",\"sessionid\":\"abc123\"}' --header \"Content-Type: application/json\" zotero.jabref.org:1969/web\n```\n\nIssue: I did not update the code.

In Jabref it is used to mark a string which shouldn't be enclosed in {} (or \"\"). In Bibtex it is used as a separator between enclosed text and strings. So I think it very much makes sense that `date = {1-4~} # nov` ends up as `1-4~#nov#` (which is what is shown in the JabRef entry editor, right?).\n =||= To clarify further (if needed) `1-4~#nov#` in JabRef means that `1-4~` will be enclosed and `nov`is a string alias/key. In the Bibtex file it means `{1-4~}` or `\"1-4~\"` and `nov` concatenated with `#` inbetween.\n =||= @koppor I remember to have analyzed the regex used by `BibtexParser.isRecognizedFormat` and that I recognized some shortcomings (as stated above). While trying to fix them, I realized that there is no simple check to recognize a valid bibtex file without actually parsing it. And since the `isRecognizedFormat` actually tried to match a regex on every single line (in the worst case), I thought that it is an easier way to just parse every bib file and then state the errors. (Moreover, the method was used on import but not while opening a database). But if you prefer, I can reinsert it.\n\nYes, in bibtex the sharp symbol is used to concatenate strings as @oscargus explained. See also for example http://www.bibtex.org/Format/ . Apparently the current state works, so I just wanted to go safe and double-check if this is really the expected behavior. Thanks @oscargus for the clarifying words.\n\nPs: Yeah, I will clean up the git history... \n =||= Regarding the `#` issue: I would propose that we remove bibtex incompatible behavior. Is it possible that we exchange JabRef's character \"`#`\" to backtick \"`\"?\n =||= For me, it's OK to remove it. Just a comment in the code to this discussion. Maybe directly to your explanation above.\n =||= I do not think it is incompatible, just confusing. :-) Using `#...#` to directly define strings in JabRef is quite well established and most of the time it is used \"stand-alone\", so only the string in the field (journal and month abbreviations). Somehow, to me, it only becomes a problem once things are concatenated and one tries to compare the bibtex field with the JabRef field and realize that the same character is used.\n\nBacktick is anyway a bad choice since it is a combining accent (on most(?) keyboard layouts) and therefore require two key presses. (GitHub is really annoying me in that respect.)\n =||= The (German) keyboard layout [neo](http://www.neo-layout.org/) offers the backtick with a single key (and a modifier key).  :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:\n\nI don't quite get the usage of `#...#`. Is it also written as such in the bib file or is it just a rendering thing in JabRef? I can live with the latter even though I find it confusing if the `bib` differs from the UI.\n =||= Just rendering in JabRef. Try writing `#a#` in a field, it will show up as `a` (not `{a}`) in the bibtex source. Write `a#b#` and it will be `{a} # b`.\n =||= Could I please get feedback about the last two open points (`GUIGlobals.META_FLAG` and the tests about newlines). Thanks!\n =||= > Made EntryType an abstract class which implements the Comparable interface and overwrites equals(Object other). Thus new expressions like entry.getType() == BibtexEntryTypes.ARTICLE return the expected result.\n\nThe second sentence is wrong. == never calls equals or hashCode or comparable, it simply checks if both reference the same instance in the heap. Because of this, I would not make the EntryType an abstract class. \n\n> Remove BibtexParser.isRecognizedFormat since the code has quite a few shortcomings (whitespace before @ or closing brackets on new lines were a problem) and the execution was quite slow for big files\n\nTo reiterate an inline comment: we aim to detect whether a file is a bibtex or biblatex file. This code can help with this. We should not delete it, but improve it. \n\n> Related to the previous point, the GUIGlobals.META_FLAG flags should be moved to another place (they are not GUI, but parser/writer logic). What would be an appropriate new home for them?\n\nAgreed. Maybe a new class called JabRefDataFormat? It is currently used in MetaData and BibtexParser. I think we should assemble all read/write logic in a single place instead of distributing it over so many classes, as the MetaData class itself does not need to know how it can persist its structure. But I am open for other ideas regarding placing and naming. \n\n>  There are 4 tests at the end of the file starting with test. These tests fail (without the @Ignore tag) but I'm not sure what they test and what would be the expected behavior in these cases.\n\nI think we should investigate. 2022983 refers to an issue number, somehow. Maybe to an old sourceforge number?\n =||= SourceForge changed global numbering of bugs to local numbering of bugs years ago. But they have redirects. Just use https://sourceforge.net/p/jabref/bugs/2022983/ as URL and it will redirect to https://sourceforge.net/p/jabref/bugs/679/.\n =||= Ok, I was wrong about the `==`. What I actually meant was that the line `Assert.assertEquals(BibtexEntryTypes.ARTICLE, e.getType());` works as expected. \n\nI liked the idea of a new `JabRefDataFormat` class and moved the meta flag there.\n\n@koppor thanks for finding the old bug report! It says that the problem was multiple spaces in file names (which would explain the naming of the tests). However, I think this bug is not fixed: if you assign a file with multiple spaces to a entry. After saving and reopening the database, the file is no longer found. Somehow the spaces are lost during parsing, which is exactly why the tests fail.\n\nFrom my side, this can be merged in. If you have no further remarks I would rebase on master.\n =||= Ok, should I rebase (and thus probably delete some of your code comments)?\n =||= Can you please rebase this on master?\n =||= Rebased. \n\nIt should be noted that I reversed a changed made in #469. Namely, Bibtexentry types are just compared by name (so a bibtex type with the same name as a biblatex type is considered the same). Otherwise all the new tests would break in biblatex mode as then getType() returns the biblatex type.

And when someone has put in a value that is not recognized by the dropdown field (old value is invalid, e.g., \"M\u00e4rz\" instead of March), then this value is lost upon save and not shown in the UI.

There seem to be no cache because switching back to the ej-technologies repro again fails on shadow.jar.\nThats quite frustrating and a waste of time.\n =||= Sorry... but I cannot reproduce this... after clearing all my gradle caches to force gradle to download the libs again the following is executed:\n\n```\n$ gradlew build\nDownload http://maven.ej-technologies.com/repository/com/install4j/gradle-plugin/6.0/gradle-plugin-6.0.pom\nDownload https://plugins.gradle.org/m2/com/github/jengelman/gradle/plugins/shadow/1.2.2/shadow-1.2.2.pom\nDownload https://plugins.gradle.org/m2/org/kt3k/gradle/plugin/coveralls-gradle-plugin/2.4.0x/coveralls-gradle-plugin-2.4.0x.pom\n[...]\nDownload http://maven.ej-technologies.com/repository/com/install4j/gradle-plugin/6.0/gradle-plugin-6.0.jar\n[...]\n```\n\nAll plugins are downloaded from `https://plugins.gradle.org/m2/...` except for the install4j plugin which is downloaded from `http://maven.ej-technologies.com`\n\nSo I do not understand why this is different for you... \n =||= The change works well so far, but is currently limited to VM args (`-Dhttp.proxyUser`and `-Dhttp.proxyPassword`).\n\nInterestingly, I found the following code section in `JabRef.jar`:\n\n``` java\n            // currently, the following cannot be configured\n            if (prefs.get(\"proxyUsername\") != null) {\n                System.setProperty(\"http.proxyUser\", prefs.get(\"proxyUsername\"));\n                System.setProperty(\"http.proxyPassword\", prefs.get(\"proxyPassword\"));\n            }\n```\n\nShall we extend the configuration and GUI to include proxyUsername and proxyPassword or just support a single proxy URL aka proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:proxyPort?\n =||= - I think the effort to parse a single proxy URL correctly without bugs is much larger than just letting the user stating the four different parts separately. But the user should be able to change these things in the GUI as well next to the other proxy settings. \n- Your commit you referenced looks very strange, I think you use different line endings, causing the file to be recreated. https://github.com/tolot27/jabref/commit/28c2c06273e0677d9ab9dc557e5e7469cc863f45\n =||= I've discovered the same problem with the commit and reverted it. Commiting it again with git rather than with Eclipse worked well.\n =||= What about password encryption if it is stored in the configuration settings (or exported)? Do we care about it? I expect so and assume that's the reason why there are currently no settings for proxy authentication.\n =||= Regarding to the proxy URL: The scheme is fixed: `@` separates the user/password from the proxy host and port. `:` separates the user name from the password as well as the proxy host from its port. Sometimes a protocol prefix is provided which is always separated by `://`.\n =||= Hm, good point. Personally, I would just make a note in the GUI that passwords are stored in the preferences. Correctly encrypting and decrypting passwords is out of scope for JabRef, I think. In addition, we could add the option that a user could pass the password as a environment parameter, if necessary. \n =||= I understand that the scheme is fixed, but parsing it without errors require a huge amount of testing as users can input anything, with feedback what went wrong. \n =||= Parsing and checking for correct input is always a problem. I don't see any checks for proxy host and port settings as well (`NetworkTab.java`) .... So you already don't care about it.\n =||= See `NetworkTab.validateSettings`, there is a check for both host name and port. \n =||= Okay, had overseen this, sorry. \n =||= I cannot see something like a preference change listener. Is there any? The problem is that a change in the proxy configuration currently requires a restart of JabRef.\nIndeed, I can change the default Authenticator in the NetworkTab or JabRefPreferences class.

This way the translators find them easily (not everybody is using Popeye). \nAnd, from time to time (typically near the release of a new version), we sort them alphabetically.\n =||= :+1: \n\nI would propose to group the entries by usage in the UI, so that related entries are appearing next to each other. I know that this is more difficult to maintain, but more easy for the translators.\n\nI think [popeye](https://github.com/JabRef/popeye) can sort the columns according to empty entries.\n =||= Mhmm... I will not group those ~1500 lines by UI usage :wink:\n =||= Some comments about sorting the keys.\nSorting alphabetically could be ok, provided that untraslated keys are grouped at the end of the file. Using popeye could be helpful in locating untraslated keys, but once translated it's difficult to came back to the just translated key, maybe to reword or reuse part of the translation. Furthermore, in some cases I put comments above or below the translated keys (e.g. when the context is not clear): when sorting alphabetically the comments will be lost. BTW, could it be possible to put comments at the end of the line?\nSo, I second the proposal from @mlep: sorting alphabetically but keep untraslated keys at the end of the file.\nEven better would be grouping by usage, but I understand the difficulty to mantain. \n =||= "], ["391", "Write unmodified entries to bib file in the same format as they were read", "J\u00f6rg Lenhard", "lenhard", "12/06/15, 04:39:37 PM", "As discussed in #116, we want to write entries that are not modified during a session back in the exact same format as they were read. This PR is WIP in this direction and not complete yet. I will continue working on it.\n\nTo be able to write back an entry in the same fashion as it is read, we need to store it upon reading. I added a field to `BibtexEntry` for storing this and tried to modify `BibtexParser` to store the file content, but to no avail. The current code of that class is pure hell (uses a global `PushBackReader` to read the file in a very confusing way) and this PR is hopefully a step towards its replacement.\n\nInstead of modifying the logic in `BibtexParser`, I extend it with additional methods that perform the new functionality on top. Current status:\n1. On initialization the complete file is read into a `List<String>` of its lines before handing it over to the old parser.\n2. After an entry has been parsed, the original represenation of the entry is looked up in the `List<String>` and stored in the entry. Blank lines following the entry belong to the entry.\n\n~~That means we read the file twice, which is terrible for large files, but as this is WIP...~~\n\nNext step will be to detect when an entry has been changed and the modification of the writing logic.\n\nThe handling of newlines currently is not consistent.", "Nice.

E.g. `@article{key1, title={a}}@article{key2, title={b}}`?\n =||= In that case, the current implementation fails.\n\nBut that gives me an idea: Isn't `@` a valid delimiter that is only used for setting bibtex entry types, but forbidden in other parts of the file? If so, I could use it for reading the file, instead of the newline character. This is very easy to do with a `Scanner` and would make things way easier.\n =||= There is the issue of comments, which potentially can contain `@`. But as far as I know, everything outside of `@xxx{..}` is a comment.\n =||= The `@` symbol can also occur in an entry, for example in an email-address. The current implementation has also the problem that it fails if the entry has no bibtex key. I fear there is no easy way to find an entry in a bibtex file without actually parsing it completely.\n =||= Isn't it possible to add a reference to the source line and column during parsing? This should be offered by ANTLR somehow, isn't it?\n\nI assume that [JBibTeX](https://github.com/jbibtex/jbibtex). Doesn't support that. Refs #123.\n =||= @oscargus: that would not be a problem. It's more of a problem if an `@` is within an entry\n\n@koppor: This is work in progress. I'll start commenting when I have something closer to finalization. Do we want to parse the file twice? If so, then jbibtex might be an option. Can you tell me if jbibtex writes back an entry in exactly the same format (up to every line feed character) as it was read?\n\n@tobiasdiez Thanks, I am aware of that. This is work in progress. I'd first like to arrive at a solution that does the round-trip for a well-structured database. Then, I'll modify it to match incomplete entries.\n =||= Ok, now this works nicely with my large local database that doesn't include analomies.\n\nNow comes the hard part: Properly reading and writing files with strange content.

I might need to discuss some of these aspects and will ping you in this thread if I am unsure.\n =||= Dammit, I wanted to get some work done today and now I am only coding JabRef...\n\nAnyways, this seems to work (and passes the tests)! I ditched my previous parsing logic and rewrote it in integration with the `BibtexParser`, which wasn't as hard as I claimed above (my bad). \n\nI am now able to store each entry exactly as it is in the file. Each entry serialization contains all text from its end up to the end of _previous_ entry. The main problem with this is that with this logic, the first entry also stores the file header and then the header is serialized twice when rewriting the file. I was able to get around that with some hacking, but there might still be edge cases I am not yet aware of.\n\nTo sum up, this needs some more manual testing, but should be pretty close.

For instance at https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/v3.0/src/test/resources/testbib/cleanup.bib, the lines above `@article{test,` should IMHO be kept when writing the file again.\n =||= @koppor: I don't think JabRef ever did that. I might be wrong of course. From what I know, the parser only parses stuff that starts with `@` and is a `preamble`, `string`, `comment`, or any entry type. I also can't find code in `FileActions` that saves arbitrary text.\n\nIf we want to store arbitrary text as well, then this is new functionality and should be done in a separate PR. \n =||= I just checked on master and can confirm that the text is removed.\n =||= Even unrecognized comments by the user are removed, see https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/master/src/main/java/net/sf/jabref/importer/fileformat/BibtexParser.java#L250\n =||= By the way, the `BibtexParser` still includes code for reading the version number (`This file was created with JabRef X.Y`). Since we stopped writing that, should I delete the parsing code?\n =||= AFAIK, we use that information for file upgrades. Maybe we should move the file update functionality in clean up or something other more accessible. I think, the \"upgrade warning\" dialog can be disabled permanently, which is not helpful when opening an old file half a year later.\n =||= As far as @simonharrer knows :smile: the version number is not used anywhere. Can you provide evidence for such file upgrades?\n =||= e.g. https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/master/src/main/java/net/sf/jabref/migrations/FileLinksUpgradeWarning.java#L65\n =||= @matthiasgeiger But that does not really depend on the version information. The version is checked, but also every file written by JabRef 3.0 is marked as problematic. The file links upgrade really depends on whether the file contains fields named `pdf` or `ps`. It wouldn't make a difference `isActionNecessary` always returned true, regardless of the version.\n\nAnyways, if you really really want the version parsing, we can keep it.\n =||= okay... I have to confess that I only performed a \"find usages\" search without truly checking whether the usages are really needed.\n\nSo feel free to remove those lines ;-)\n =||= I removed the old meta flag and version parsing. Version headers are now simply removed on rewrite. File upgrade functionality ultimately depends on preferences (and on whether JabRef finds errors in the file to begin with).\n =||= So, from my point of view this PR is complete and ready to merge.\n\n@koppor and I did some more testing with more advanced things like meta-data and it seems fine. I'm not guaranteeing the absence of bugs, but there should be no more obvious mistakes. \n\nSomebody else can take a final look and merge this with master.\n =||= Looks good to me.

Once this happens all buttons are inactive and I have to kill the process. This started today after Java got upgraded, so maybe this has something to do with it. Previously this was not a problem. I have looked at the FAQ but it doesn't seem relevant.\n\nAny solutions would be really handy as I am pretty reliant of Jabref to manage my bibliographies.\n\nThanks, Nicholas", "We did not change any code in JabRef 2.10 since its [release  in March 2014](http://jabref.sourceforge.net/revisionhistory.php#v2.10). Therefore, this should be an JRE issue. Could you downgrade your JRE? As soon as you know the JRE version where JabRef runs, could you report this as an issue to the [ubuntu bug tracker](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/jabref)?\n\nMeanwhile, you can try Java8 and [the latest build](http://builds.jabref.org/master/). I am afraid, that this won't succeed, too.\n\nThe only thing, that currently helps is to upgrade to Oracle's JRE using the [oracle-java8-installer](https://launchpad.net/~webupd8team/+archive/ubuntu/java).\n =||= At least 2.11 should also work with OpenJDK 8 - see #168.\n =||= As reported above, I too use Ubuntu 15.10, and I have tried both the version in the repository (2.10) and the last stable version available (2.11.1).\n- **Version 2.10 using java 1.7 (openjdk)**: cannot test it because even if I change the default java from 1.8 to 1.7 system wide, it uses java 1.8 (this should probably be a separate bug..)\n- **Version 2.10 using java 1.8 (openjdk)**: sometimes it hangs on the splashscreen, sometimes it starts up and load the last file I edited, but as soon as I try to click around or open another file, it hangs (with no errors printed on the console, except warnings such as \"Could not get key binding for \"Open folder\"\")\n- **Version 2.11.1  (jar) using java 1.7 (openjdk)**: starts up and load the last file I edited, but as soon as I try to do something like clicking around or opening another file, it hangs\n- **Version 2.11.1  (jar) using java 1.8 (openjdk)**: starts up and load the last file I edited, but as soon as I try to open another file, it hangs (more precisely, it hangs as I click on a folder in the standard java open file dialog window)\n\nSo right now I don't know any trivial way of using JabRef on the last version of Ubuntu.\nThanks, \nPaolo\n =||= :disappointed: \n\nHave you tried it with oracle-jdk?\n =||= Nope, unfortunately I don't have time to install it (it's not in the Ubuntu repositories) nor to do other tests..\n(Anyway, OpenJDK is the official reference implementation of Java SE, so you should use it to develop JabRef... :wink: )\n =||= All current developers of JabRef use Windows. I have not found an openjdk implementation that can be installed on windows. Do you have any pointers for us?\n =||= Uh, I wasn't aware that openjdk is only available for Linux :confused: so much for \"write once, run everywhere\"\nStill, since I reckon Linux is widely used by researchers, I suggest you should pay more attention to its compatibility. \nAnyway, thanks for the work you guys did and do on JabRef: it's a very useful piece of software. :smiley: \n\nI'll try to run it with oracle-jdk as soon as I can...\n =||= The same problem has been happening to me today.  I've just submitted a report to Ubuntu bug tracker.\n =||= Hm, you could try to run the jar via `java -jar jabref.jar` (jar can be downloaded directly from our mirrors) and then give us any stacktraces for debugging purposes. \n =||= No stacktraces nor errors get printed.\nSo as suggested [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/hangloop-140257.html#gbzay) I tried to run the jar (2.11.1, with openjdk 7) and then get a thread dump using `jstack`.\nI enclose two log files: one before it gets stuck, and one after.\n[jabref_jstack-before.txt](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/files/45114/jabref_jstack-before.txt)\n[jabref_jstack-after.txt](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/files/45116/jabref_jstack-after.txt)\n\nIn short, after it gets stuck, some thread in charge of painting some graphical component appears to be in BLOCKED state.\nSo it seems to me that this is a (major) bug of the GTK look&feel implementation.\nBesides, for the record, recently I had similar problems with other java software such as Freemind and Netbeans.\n =||= For the record [1520294](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/jabref/+bug/1520294) is Ubuntu's bug number.\n =||= In Preferences -> Advanced you could change the look and feel if you are able to get there. Maybe this helps. \n =||= Indeed it works. I switched to MetalLookAndFeel, restarted, and it doesn't get stuck anymore (using any java version).\nGreat, thanks for the hint!\n(Maybe don't mark this as solved so that people with this problem can come here and read about the workaround - waiting for a proper fix..)\n =||= Fantastic!  Just done the same and it works :-)  Many thanks Simon!\n\nPS. Please move Jabref off Sourceforge.  It is so dodgy nowadays... \n =||= Maybe we should change the default for linux based systems. \n =||= I was having a very similar problem.  I tried lots of things in vane (I tried using `openjdk-6`, `7` and `8`; I tried doing `apt-get purge` on everything relating to Java on my system and deleting `~/.java` and then re-installing openjdk and JabRef etc... but jabref still crashed).  I'm on Ubuntu 15.10.  \n\nBefore I found this bug report (i.e. before I saw that a work-around is to change to MetalLookAndFeel), the one thing that I found to work was to edit `/etc/java-7-openjdk/accessibility.properties` and comment out `assistive_technologies=org.GNOME.Accessibility.AtkWrapper`.  I just thought I'd mention this in case it's useful for debugging!\n\nThanks to all the JabRef devs.  It really is a great bit of software!\n\nI'd definitely recommend keeping an eye on how well JabRef works on Linux.  As others have said, there are probably quite a few researchers who use Linux pretty much exclusively (like me).\n =||= Thank you for the nice words about JabRef! As this is an open source project, we do welcome help. At the moment we are lacking a developer who uses Linux as his main operating system. :)\n =||= ... and developers using Macs are also welcome...\n\n... and we would even accept help from people who are using Windows :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: \n =||= ...and female developers... (so \"her operating system\" is also OK.)\n =||= Thanks for the work around of changing the Look and Feel. I agree with others that it would be nice to have it work out of the box on Linux again! It did take me some unproductive time trying to figure out what went wrong before I found this issue.\n =||= For the record:\n\nJabRef works out of the box on CentOS 6.7, kernel 2.6.32-573.3.1.el6.x86_64, GNOME 2.28.2.\n\njava version \"1.8.0_65\"\nJava(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_65-b17)\nJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.65-b01, mixed mode)\n\nNot sure if this is pure luck (as I do not administer the computer myself).\n\nI think one problem here is that \"Linux\" is rather badly defined... Without knowing any details it appears as if the major source of the problem is that parts of OpenJDK are not thread-safe. A patch is proposed that probably would solve the problem (since August), but OpenJDK is not keen on applying it.\n =||= @oscargus What is the default look and feel used with this CentOS machine?\n =||= Assuming that JabRef reports the correct thing in the preference dialog (or is there a better way?): com.sun.java.swing.plaf.gtk.GTKLookAndFeel\n =||= Confirmed the look and feel value was the problem on Ubuntu 15.10:\n\n```\nopenjdk version \"1.8.0_66-internal\"\nOpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_66-internal-b17)\nOpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.66-b17, mixed mode)\n```\n\nPreferences should be in `~/.java/.userPrefs/net/sf/jabref/prefs.xml`. There should be a key called lookAndFeel with the GTK theme set (line 94), change the line to:\n`<entry key=\"lookAndFeel\" value=\"javax.swing.plaf.metal.MetalLookAndFeel\"/>`\nor:\n`<entry key=\"lookAndFeel\" value=\"javax.swing.plaf.metal.SynthLookAndFeel\"/>`\n\np.s. @oscargus, The GTKLookAndFeel failed on Ubuntu 15.10 with `java 1.7.0_95` and `java 1.8.0_66`.\n =||= @simonharrer You remember when we tried this in Stuttgart togetehr with a student? Do you remember which algorithm we suggested to switch from the LAF to metal? I thought we found the problem or at least a check when we need to switch?\n =||= Hm, I do not recall it perfectly, but it was something like:\n- check OS\n- if on linux, set to MetalLookAndFeel as default\n- a user can later change to another look and feel, but this is then up to the user\n =||= I think it wasn't just `if on linux` but a certain special case...\n =||= I have been having this bug for a while, but I could not even launch JabRef in Ubuntu. Even after changing the prefs.xml file. On my system it would almost always freeze at the splash screen, which then would block my view of terminals and other windows. I would have to \"killall java\" to get rid of the splash screen.\n\nWhat did seem to help was deleting my .java directory (to wipe all Java/JabRef config information) then opening it again. When I reopened JabRef, the default look and feel was GTK (it was Plastic3D before) and I could change the look and feel settings. I can now open and reopen JabRef without freezing.\n\nThis suggests that the problem may be related to older config settings that are not being corrected when Ubuntu updates JabRef and/or Java. Of course this work-around (wiping all Java settings) is only an option for me since on my machine only JabRef requires java.\n\nUnfortunately, I did not save my old config files before I started trying to fix things. So I cannot really dig into this further. I do know that uninstalling and reinstalling JabRef let me get past the splash screen once, then it would freeze again. I even removed JabRef with the \"completely remove including config files\" option in the synaptic package manager, but this does not delete the local settings in the user's home directory (i.e. the .java directory).\n\nHopefully this helps.\n =||= My problem in Stuttgart was caused when using OpenJDK and GTKLookAndFeel. In my case when I want to open a file and navigate through the filechooser the GUI freezes. When using the Oracle JDK it works normal. Another way to solve it is to use MetalLookAndFeel with OpenJDK.\n =||= Hi, I can confirm that commenting out `assistive_technologies` \nin `/etc/java-8-openjdk/accessibility.properties` mentioned above by JackKelly\nfixes the lockup on Ubuntu 16.04 with openjdk-8. Yours, Steffen\n =||= Hm, maybe we can do this as part of the installer on ubuntu?\n =||= https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=813143\n =||= Does #1116 mean JabRef 3.3 works safely with OpenJDK?\n =||= In response to a request by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Darboux \"Which \"Look and Feel\" are you using? (this is displayed in Options -> Preferences -> Appearance) Could you confirm (or not) that JabRef 3.3 does not work with the GTK Look and Feel under Linux? \"\n\nI have tried changing from the default javax.swing.plaf.metal.MetalLookAndFeel to com.jgoodies.looks.plastic.Plastic3DLookAndFeel; JabRef restart OK but I cannot see any difference in the look-and-feel. When I select com.jgoodies.looks.windows.WindowsLookAndFeel, the restart announces that the specified LaF cannot be found and JabRef is reverting to the default. There is no GTK Look and Feel in the drop-down box.\n\nHope this helps. I am using Linux Mint 17.3 + OpenJDK 8.\n =||= @mlep No, it just uses the Metal LookAndFeel by default and therefore (hopefully) prevents the current issues. If you change to another LAF you are at the same point as before.\n =||= We also cannot confirm that GTK LAF does not work for anyone, but there are obviously problems for some...\n =||= \"We also cannot confirm that GTK LAF does not work for anyone, but there are obviously problems for some...\"  Sorry, but that doesn't make any sense!\n\nFurther to my earlier post, I have had a look at changing the LaF on Windows. I cannot see any difference between any of the LaFs! (Much like Linux.) What changes should I expect to see if this working as intended?\n =||= Sorry, but my response wasn't targeted at your question. \n\nRegarding your question: \nI don't know why you cannot see any difference between LAFs. Imho, this is another issue that need not to be related with the topic here. Maybe you don't have the LAF inside the classpath? Normally it should not be displayed if so, so maybe it's a bug. I think this needs to be discussed in a separate issue.\n =||= This is out of our hands.

(Where an author/editor/title/... is missing?) \n\nIf you can determine a specific entry that is causing this trouble it would be nice if you can post the BibTeX source here.\n =||= Thanks, we are closer :) It is the file field. I am using a BibTex file that I exported from Mendeley, and one (of many) entry that I verified causes the error even if I remove everything else is:\n\n@Book{AttouchHedy;ButtazzoGiuseppe;Michaille,\n  Title                    = {{Variational Analysis in Sobolev and BV Spaces}},\n  Author                   = {{Attouch, Hedy; Buttazzo, Giuseppe; Michaille}, Gerard},\n  File                     = {:C$\\backslash$:/Users/[myname]/Dropbox/Studies/Books/Analysis/[Hedy{_}Attouch,{_}Giuseppe{_}Buttazzo,{_}Gerard{_}MichailleVariationalBV.pdf:pdf}\n}\n =||= Actually, the stuff Mendeley gave me looks so wrong, that I am thinking about just building up my library from scratch and not hoping for any other program to fix that for me. \n\nBut I still think JabRef should be able to survive reading that without crashing to not scare away other new users.\n =||= Yes. You are right, there are some major problems with the parsing of the file field, which already caused some other trouble (see #184).\n\nSemi-offtopic: You might use other export formats from mendely (e.g. RIS) and try to import these in JabRef - this is quite ridiculous but maybe the result is cleaner this way.\n =||= I close this issue - the underlying reason will be tracked by #402.\n =||= RIS works better in that it doesn't add curly braces around title this way (see another issue I posted). Also  it does solve the search problem, since the file field is not imported (or not exported in the RIS? it doesn't appear anyway).\n =||= @koppor may be relevant for stupro regarding RIS importer\n =||= "], ["400", "Clean up entries does not remove curly braces around titles", "Soeren Wolfers", "soerenwolfers", "11/27/15, 02:08:59 PM", "I imported a BibTex file from Mendeley and I tried using JabRefs \"Cleanup entries\" to get at least some order in that mess Mendeley created. However, it does not remove curly braces around titles, such as \"{Applied Functional Analysis}\". Neither does it convert 1st, 2nd to real superscripts, such as \"{The Linux Command Line, 2nd Internet Edition}\".\n\nI have Windows 7, Jabref 2.11.1, up-to-date Java and there are no exceptions thrown.", "For example, the tool does not work on a bibliography consisting only of the following entry:\n\n@Book{AttouchHedy;ButtazzoGiuseppe;Michaille,\n  Title                    = {{Variational Analysis in Sobolev and BV Spaces}},\n  Author                   = {{Attouch, Hedy; Buttazzo, Giuseppe; Michaille}, Gerard}\n}\n =||= I do not think that it should cleanup those things.

Assume that the title is \"{VHDL}\", in which case you do not want this.\n\nHowever, I guess that one can have a specific command for this (one of my co-authors insists of adding '...' around every entry...), but it should probably not be in the regular clean-up, as the clean-up should do things which are always good.\n =||= First of all, the cleanup scripts are currently being reworked.\n\nTrying to reproduce this on current master:\n- [x] Superscripts cleanup is working as expected for me.\n- [ ] Remove unecessary $, {, } does indeed not work.\n =||= I would disagree. The problem is that it is more or less impossible to automatically tell if the {} in @Bananach .bib-file is incorrect. What that clean-up is doing is stuff like \"{FIR} {FPGA}\" => \"{FIR FPGA}\" and \"$\\alpha$$\\times$$\\beta$\" => \"$\\alpha\\times\\beta$\".\n =||= I'm particulary refering to the first post in this issue not the indeed strange author field in the example bib file `Author = {{Attouch, Hedy; Buttazzo, Giuseppe; Michaille}, Gerard}`.\n =||= Maybe I also misunderstand the purpose of the superscript clean up. Say I have a book with title \"Foo, 2nd edition\". Should it make \"Foo, 2\\textsuperscript{nd} Edition\" out of that?\n =||= Yes it should. And it does at least for me on the current master. Try out http://builds.jabref.org/master/jabref_windows_3_0dev--snapshot--2015-11-27--master--fc563ef.exe\n =||= Yes, that works now.\n =||= Me too. How would JabRef know that those {} are not there on purpose? \n\nConsider citing the article \"FPGAs in the IoT\". (http://www.eejournal.com/archives/articles/20140715-lattice) Almost any .bst should render it exactly like that, why not put {} around the whole title rather than \"{FPGAs} in the {IoT}\" or  \"{FPGA}s in the {I}o{T}\"?\n =||= True. \nOfftopic: Do you know why LateX does not automatically treat the title as if I had curly braces around it? Can curly braces do anything that I do not intend? \n =||= The .bst-file specifies how everything should be typeset, including casing. For example, in IEEEtran.bst book titles are left as is, but article-titles are made lower case. I think it makes very much sense that bibtex \"corrects\" it. In this way, one can use the same bibtex-file without worrying about the final format.\n =||= No, curly braces will only do what you intend (or what you wrote at least).\n\nAs some sort of measure: there are more than 7500 citation styles supported by CSL: http://citationstyles.org/ so having something generating the correct citation from a unified source is quite useful.\n =||= What I mean is: assume everything in my Mendeley library was perfect. Now, after the move to JabRef, I have curlybraces around every title. Should I bother removing them by hand?\n =||= Maybe. It depends on how often you change publisher and how different their .bst:s are.\n =||= ... and the curly braces just preserve your \"perfect\" entries: {...} tells BibTeX to print the title exactly as specified without changing the casing.

I know this can be prevented by w rapping uppercase letters in braces, e.g. \"{T}he life cycle of {A}tlantic salmon\", but this is too much work. Can JabRef help?\n> A: JabRef has a setting that will automatically wrap all capital letters for certain fields in { } - this will make sure they are preserved in the LaTeX output. Under Options -> Preferences -> General -> File -> \u201cStore the following fields with braces around capital letters\u201d, make sure the title field is included. To do this for several fields, write e.g. \u201ctitle;abstract\u201d (without the quotes). This setting automatically adds braces when saving the bib file, but you won't see the braces within JabRef.\n> (Source: http://jabref.sourceforge.net/faq.php)\n\nSo it is by design, that JabRef don't show the braces in the title field, but in the BibTeX-code. But then the check integrity message \"large capitals are not masked using curly brackets {}\" for the title field doesn't make any sense.\n =||= I have related issues with curly brackets (using a recent dev jabref version). To reproduce: create a new database, and do doi to bibtex from 10.1175/jamc-d-14-0299. Then:\n- In the bib source the title reads \" title =         {{AI}{RS}, {IASI}, and {CrIS} {R}etrieval {R}ecords at {C}limate {S}cales: {A}n {I}nvestigation into the {P}ropagation of {S}ystematic {U}ncertainty},\"\n- In the title field it reads: \"{AI}{RS}, IASI, and {CrIS} Retrieval Records at Climate Scales: An Investigation into the Propagation of Systematic Uncertainty.\" It is unclear to me why some brackets are displayed and others not.\n- Check integrity warns \"large capitals are not masked using curly brackets\".  I am really not sure why since there seem to be enough curly brackets!\n- When I do clean up entries, the title field reads {AIRS}, IASI, and {CrIS} Retrieval Records at Climate Scales: An Investigation into the Propagation of Systematic Uncertainty. This is better but the integrity check still complains. \n\nAnother doi example: 10.5194/amt-4-1383-2011\n\nI have 100s of warnings from the integrity check on this, so I would be grateful for a solution! Thanks in advance.\n =||= I think this is somehow related to the preference setting \"Store the following fields with braces around capital letters\". It seems like the curly braces are removed from the table view and the entry editor if this is set for a particular field, but not otherwise. It would make sense to always remove them from the table, but never from the entry editor, independent of the setting.\n\nI'm not a big fan of the title integrity check since it is fundamentally wrong. All these things are determined by the .bst-file and it is OK to write titles in title case, one should just not expect it to stay like that. Also, the correct way is to enclose the complete word in curly brackets, not just the capital letters.\n =||= To support the last point of @oscargus, here a small quote from the biblatex manual:\n\n> In bib \ufb01les designed with traditional BibTeX in mind, it has been fairly common to\n> only wrap single letters in braces to prevent case-changing: `title = {An Introduction to {L}a{T}e{X}}`\n> The problem with this convention is that the braces will suppress the kerning on\n> both sides of the enclosed letter. It is preferable to wrap the entire word in braces.\n =||= @simonharrer Didn't you remove this auto initialization logic? So we can close this now?\n =||= Yes, but I think we need to update the FAQ so that save actions should be used. @mlep could you help out here?\n =||= Can we please document this and close the issue in the near future? I'm not really into this so I'd prefer if some of the participants can fix this documentation issue.\n =||= Previous Q&A removed by  @matthiasgeiger .\nI have just added a Q&A about save actions .\nThis should also be documented in an help file.

Imagine you want to test a method `format(String value)` in the class `BracesFormatter` which removes double braces in the given string.\n- _Placing:_ all tests should be placed in a class named `classTest`, e.g. `BracesFormatterTest`. \n- _Naming:_ the name should be descriptive enough to describe the whole test. Use the format `methodUnderTest_exspectedBehaviour_context` (without the dashes). So for example `formatRemovesDoubleBracesAtBeginning`. Some people prefer an additional `test` prefix, but I think this is redundant as the class name already entails that we are dealing with tests. See also the [Stackoverflow discussion](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/155436/unit-test-naming-best-practices).\n- _Test only one thing per test:_ tests should be short and test only one small part of the method. So instead of \n\n```\ntest() {\n   assertEqual(\"test\", format(\"test\"));\n   assertEqual(\"{test\", format(\"{test\"));\n   assertEqual(\"test\", format(\"{{test\"));\n   assertEqual(\"test\", format(\"test}}\"));\n   assertEqual(\"test\", format(\"{{test}}\"));\n}\n```\n\nwe would have five tests containing a single `assert` statement and named accordingly (`formatDoesNotChangeStringWithoutBraces`, `formatDoesNotRemoveSingleBrace`, `formatRemovesDoubleBracesAtBeginning`, etc.). See [JUnit AntiPattern](http://www.exubero.com/junit/antipatterns.html#Multiple_Assertions) for background.\n- Do _not just test happy paths_, but also wrong/weird input.\n- Try to write tests _before_ you actually implement the functionality (test driven development).\n- _Bug fixing:_ write a test case covering the bug and then fix it, leaving the test as a security that the bug will never reappear.\n- _Integration testing:_ we should use a different class for this higher level testing and not mix them with unit tests.\n\nAs I have said above, these things should just service as a starting point for further discussions. They are more or less a distillation of some guides I read about unit testing.", "A good idea and definitely something that should be documented!\n\nI agree with practically everything you write. My discussion points are:\n- TDD is fine, but we shouldn't be dogmatic about enforcing it.\n- Regarding integration testing: Currently, nearly all tests are integration tests (they combine objects of different classes for a test and check their interaction). Building true unit tests would require the usage of mocks and stubs and this would require to rewrite nearly all tests. More importantly, JabRef is so tightly coupled in many positions that unit tests are impossible to write without a major rewrite of the program (I am talking about the infamous `Globals` class and the like). I don't think we have the resources for that and, therefore, I would just keep unit and integration tests together. \n =||= Moreover, apart from those rather general (but nonetheless important!) aspects we should create and document specific guidelines and best-practices. \nSome food for thoughts:\n- Testing preferences without affecting the stored prefs for the developer\n- creating and using databases, entries, ... for test purposes\n- ...\n =||= Another point is which mocking/stubbing framework should we use? According to a [Stackoverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22697/whats-the-best-mock-framework-for-java), [Mockito](http://mockito.org/) is the way to go. After reading a little bit through their documentation, I have to admit that I really like the syntax. Other opinions?\n =||= It is, but I am not sure if we should build a strong unit test harness based on the currently hard to test classes with a lot of global variables and singletons. The most gain is in tests using the CLI commands and checking input/output or testing classes or testing whole modules through their main interfaces. Additionally, GUI testing would also have quite some gain, but would also require additional libraries and will be obsolete in some parts when migrating to JavaFX. \n =||= Yes, Mockito wouldn't help to solve the problem of to many global objects floating around. But it is a necessary tool for testing _good_ code. If you write new code (or refactor old one) in a proper fashion (i.e. not relaying on global objects), then the tests really need a mocking framework. \n\nLet me give you an example: you have suggested in #467 that there should be a new class \n\n```\npublic class LastFocusedTabPreferences {\n\n    public LastFocusedTabPreferences (JabRefPreferences prefs) {\n    }\n\n    public void setLastFocusedTab(File file) {\n       // make absolute path, set, ...\n    }\n\n    public boolean hasHadLastFocus(File file) {\n       // true if file.absolutePath.equals(getLastFocusedTab())\n    }\n}\n```\n\nA proper test for these methods would require a mock of the JabRefPreferences class, so that we can test if changes are properly stored (without actually changing the preferences). Now JabRefPreferences should derive from an interface so that we can insert a custom mock into the constructor of `LastFocusedTabPreferences`. This does not change the problem of a singleton preference class, but at least the new class `LastFocusedTabPreferences` is free of these shortcomings, is properly tested and has no references to global objects. Without a mocking framework it would be way easier to erase the constructor of `LastFocusedTabPreferences` completely and store the changes directly in the singleton preference class. Works but is no longer testable.\n =||= Who writes the test cases for the mocks? :sunglasses:\n\nDo we have resources for writing mocks? Would people writing mocks spend time to fix other things? On top or instead of? Or would they only write mocks instead of doing anything? If that latter is the case, we can go for mocks. If anything else is the case, I would spend time on improve existing code and test coverage.\n\nIs JabRef really that large that we need mocks? I agree for large projects, where many side effects arise (such as the [Apache ODE BPEL Engine](http://ode.apache.org/)), but for JabRef?\n =||= The people from Mockito write tests for the mocks, not us (actually, they are at a coverage of 80%+ instead of our 14%). In my opinion, mocks are useful for every project size. For example a typical test using preferences could like this (example taken from #469)\n\n``` java\n@Test\npublic void testBibLatexMode() {\n     // Mock preferences\n     JabrefPreferences mockedPrefs = mock(JabrefPreferences.class);        \n     // Switch to BibLatex mode\n     when(mockedPrefs.getBoolean(\"BiblatexMode\")).thenReturn(true);\n\n     // Now test\n     EntryTypes biblatexentrytypes = new EntryTypes(mockedPrefs);\n     assertEquals(BibLatexEntryTypes.ARTICLE, biblatexentrytypes.getType(\"article\"));\n}\n```\n\nIn my opinion, this code is way simpler, easier to write and understand. \n\nThe aim of a mocking framework is to increase test coverage by making it easier to write tests. \n =||= When doing `when(mockedPrefs.getBoolean(\"BiblatexMode\")).thenReturn(true);`: Who tests that? :smiley: OK, that's an edge case.\n\nYou example convinces me.\n =||= I know how Mockito works and I really like it as a testing library. But with the current amount of code change/refactoring, I do not think this approach of unit testing is feasible. Because when you change/refactor the class you have to rewrite the unit tests coming with it. Because of this, I like to have more tests at the CLI level, or at higher API calls. They can give feedback if my internal change is still working. And do not have to touch them, as they depend only on quite small APIs. \n =||= I see your point @simonharrer. Of course tests make it sometimes harder to refactor something. That is true. But don't you think that some parts of JabRef have a relatively stable API and would profit immensely from through-out unit testing? I was thinking about the parser, export + import functionality, the formatters, etc. \nWhat about a compromise: add Mockito to the arsenal, but allow it only for testing specific parts (like the above for example).\n =||= From my point of view, the compromise is fine. We can add Mockito, which, to the best of my knowledge, is the most convenient mocking library for Java. If someone wants to use mocking, he can do so, but no one is forced to. \n\nWhat JabRef would really benefit from in my point of view, would be a big roundtrip test, e.g. startup the ui, load a database, add/modify an entry, save the database. But this is really hard due to the UI.\n =||= Basically the CLI commands could do this roundtrip as they are quite flexible. Especially, if we make cleanups available there as well. \n =||= I just added most of the points we have discussed above to [the wiki](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/wiki/Code-Howtos#test-cases). Feel free to further improve the wiki pages and/or correct what I added. \n =||= @tobiasdiez Could you have a look at https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/508#issuecomment-196202065 - especially regarding the file names used for parameterized tests?\n =||= @koppor I have no objections about the suggested file names. But I'm not sure that you even need to split the test into two files...\n =||= The splitting is required as for each parameter, **all** tests are executed. This makes reading the tests result very hard. For instance, the check for the formatter name won't change if other checks are done. When I have 5 tests, 3 of them changing based on the parameters, and 2 of them never changing, should they be included in the iteration? I don't think so.\n\n![grabbed_20160314-100110](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1366654/13739482/b68b6264-e9cb-11e5-8704-c96f4293829d.png)\n\nversus\n\n![grabbed_20160314-100144](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1366654/13739495/c7474190-e9cb-11e5-824a-04ed2bb23c7a.png)\n\nI prefer the latter.\n\nBranch: cryptedpdfs.

Normally, it's simply the directory of the .bib file (meaning `.` is used as database directory). But what if the users somehow share a bibliography and use different directories? Then, this feature comes in. I can set another directory then you do. Both settings are serialized in the `bib` file. With `-<loginname>` as suffix in the `jabref-meta` field. If JabRef saves a file and my loginname matches the name stored in the `bib` file, it chooses that directory. If no match is found, it uses the \"General file directory\" of the bib file.

Or render `.` as `<directory of the bib file is used>`. Then, hopefully, the \"User-specific file directory\" can be dropped. - I don't see any other use case. Why would I share a bib file and not share the PDFs?

The `EntryTypes` class uses a static initializer which is only called once when loading the class for the first time. During that time, it sets of the entry types, and ignores the value afterwards. We should refactor this, as we aim to have a file-based bibtex/latexmode switch instead of a global one. \n =||= Weird though that the test works on my computer, so there the\ninitialization of EntryTypes is apparently not done before the mode is\nswitched.\n\nAnyway, with database-local EntryTypes this will be solved (eventually).\nMay require quite a bit of refactoring though, considering how things work\nnow (or maybe not).

I'm thinking that may lead to additional hints. SELECT \\* FROM entry_types; ?\n =||= Oscar,\n\nI did a select \\* from entry_types; on that table.  There are numerous \ncolumns.  Too wide to display properly here.  I used pgadmin3 to look at \nthe databases instead.  Haven't had the time to really look at things in \ndetail though.  The problem is that the field entry_types_id is not \nunique for 3.0.  It is for 2.11 and previous.

Looks awful and has some nice new features!\n\nWorking on OpenSuse 13.1 I can confirm the above problem. Actually, I cannot import any files like *.bib or *.ris using Crtl-I. I get the error message \"No entries found. Please make sure you are using the correct import filter.\"  No output in the error console. To be sure, I did import exactly the same files with Jabref 2.11 a minute ago.  Actually, when I remember correctly,   in pre-2.11 versions one did not even have to select the  proper file type (RIS, BIBTEX etc) which became necessary at least with 2.11. \n\nThanks!!\n =||= @tobiasdiez Could it be that we changed the behavior `isRecognizedFormat` from 2.x to 3.0?\n\n@PUKK Why aren't you opening BibTeX files with the normal File-Open-Functionality? :innocent: \n =||= I want to include a reference into an existing database. Actually, using File-open with the same *.bib file works but opens a new database.  That's not what \"Import into current database\" is supposed to do, isn't it?\n\nIn addition, in my standard workflow I do use a one-line script called from within Firefox. The one-line script reads\n\n java -jar ~/bin/JabRef.jar --importToOpen $(readlink -f $1)\n\nThis worked flawlessly with Jabref 2.11 but not with 3.0.  Nothing happens when calling this using Jabref 3.0. Maybe the two problems are connected. \n =||= as PUKK pointed out everything was fine until i upgraded to 3.0.\nI am in the middle of writing my phd thesis and jabref is my main reference manager. So I hope someone will be able to resolve it asap. \n =||= @PUKK @mazeratti Please double check that you have \"Listen for remote operation on port: 6050\" enabled. (Preferences/Advanced). Regarding \"asap\", @mazeratti did you check our [backing page](http://www.jabref.org/#backing)?\n =||= @koppor Yes, \"Listen for remote operation on port: 6050\" was enabled in my tests.  Is there any debugging option or similar, so that I can help nailing down the problem? \n =||= In \"Help/Error Console\". What is said in the tab \"Output\" and \"Exceptions\"? Maybe restart JabRef to have the output cleaned. Further, what is the output of the script calling `--importToOpen`?\n\nOn my quick experiments (on Windows 8.1), the import dialog was hidden somewhere behind. I could get it working when JabRef was shown next to the browser window.\n =||= The \"Output\" indeed shows (I overlooked before that I need to close and reopen the error console to get an update): \nImporting in unknown format: /tmp/achs_jpcbfk119_14971.ris\nCould not find a suitable import format.\nImporting in unknown format: /tmp/achs_jpcbfk119_14971.bib\nFormat used: BibTeX\n\nAnd yes, I might have been wrong and not seen the hidden import dialog (which was up front in 2.11). So indeed the BibTeX import seems to work as originally reported by @mazeratti (sorry for the confusion on my side). Still RIS (and probably other formats) have a problem.\n\nThanks for the quick feedback!!\n =||= Could you please try the following: Open the import dialog, chooser your file and (this is important!) also select the importer from the drop-down below (titled \"Files of type\"). After this the format should be recognized.\n\n@developers:\nThe reason is that the `ImportFormat` is not recognized based on the file path. That is, in the following lines the `format` is initialized with null because `ff` is not an `ImportFileFilter` but a `BasicFileFilter`.\n\n``` java\n// net.sf.jabref.importer.ImportFormats\n                FileFilter ff = fc.getFileFilter();\n                ImportFormat format = null;\n                if (ff instanceof ImportFileFilter) {\n                    format = ((ImportFileFilter) ff).getImportFormat();\n                }\n```\n =||= For my tests I use, for example, inputs from the American Chemical Society. Here an example so that you maybe can better reproduce my issue\nhttp://pubs.acs.org/action/showCitFormats?doi=10.1021%2Facs.jpcb.5b08970\n\nNow using \"File ->Import into Current Database\" I cannot import neither the BIB nor the RIS files from the above link. As stated in my original post, I get the error message \n\"No entries found. Please make sure you are using the correct import filter.\" \nAnd yes, I did select the proper format \n\nUsing --importToOpen the error console statements are given in my previous post and only the BIB\ngets imported.\n =||= @koppor Yes \u201clisten for remote operation on port 6050\u201d is enabled\n\n@tobiasdiez I tried importing a .ris file by selecting RIS filter but I am receiving the error message \u201cNo entries found. Please make sure you are using the correct import filter\u201d and as previously mentioned no messages in help -> error console -> output or exceptions\n =||= While you look at fixing the import issues which did work before in 2.11, there are enhancements which would be nice to have (and were not there in 2.11):\n- When importing a single entry, a \"key\" should be generated automatically (is done) which actually observes the rules defined Options -> BibTex key generator -> default pattern (wrong key generated). If clicking on \"Generate now\" while importing, the correct key is generated.\n- After closing the import window, Jabref \"should\" jump to (or select)  the imported entry in the main window (maybe optional). Since one cannot edit entries in the import window (or even see all fields depending on the preview), I always have to search for the newly imported entry to check if the entry is fine and often manual fine-tuning is still needed (at least I usually have to select how the journal name is abbreviated). \n- I do have still quite some problems with special characters in entries like\n  http://pubs.acs.org/action/showCitFormats?doi=10.1021%2Facs.jpclett.5b02390\n  I know this is a complex issue and I see you are working on this. But anyway I wanted to provide a specific example. In my experience it sometimes helps, to be pointed at a specific problem.\n\nThanks for considering these issues and again thanks for all your effort and time!!!\n =||= Hi,\n\nIs there a way to download 2.10  dmg file ? Till the new version is released I would like to work with 2.10. \n\nI have also noticed that V 3.0, does not remember the last folder opened. For ex. if I want to import the downloaded .ris or .bib file each time I have to show the path to the downloaded folder. The default is the folder where my jabref database is stored. For the previous versions this was not the case. \n =||= The Mac Zip file for 2.10 is still available at sourceforge here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/jabref/files/jabref/2.10/JabRef-2.10-OSX.zip/download\n\nSorry, I still had not found the time to investigate the importing issue - hopefully in the next few days...\n =||= Thanks for the info Matthias. I had already tried that link. jabref file downloads but when I try to install it I am getting the error message that the file is damaged. Is there any other source from where I could download it ? I tried a couple of them, but almost all of them points to the newer version jabref V 3.0. \n\n![screen shot 2015-12-09 at 10 11 22 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16189990/11698989/14c17620-9ec2-11e5-9f12-427187aff008.png)\n =||= @mazeratti Could you please check our [Mac OS X FAQ](http://jabref.sourceforge.net/faq.php#osx)? Does it help?\n\nPossibly 2.11 beta 3 might also still run on Mac OS X: https://sourceforge.net/projects/jabref/files/jabref/2.11%20beta%203/. It should be fine to use.

Normally when the firewall blocks, the message says you cannot open it from an unidentified developer but when you right click and open, it works. That wasn't the case here, so I thought it had something to do with the file itself. Sorry for not checking up the FAQ, I was not aware that the firewall caused it.\n\nOnce again thanks for the help you all extended. Hope the bug in V 3.0 will be fixed in the next update. \n\nBetween, I also did not know that I can support jabref by ordering books from amazon via the link provided. Is there a more detailed info about the same ? If i click the link, it opens up a few selected books. Is the supported limited to those books only ? or can I order a book of my choice via the link. \n =||= @mazeratti You can order anything you like. The important thing only is to start from the link. I'll update the text accordingly the next days.\n =||= I think, this is solved via https://github.com/boceckts/jabref/commit/b773a126a29659a270100014805f027512786706. I don't know, why it worked earlier. The `isRecognizedFormat` reads from an `InputStream` and the real importer uses the **same** `InputStream`. This was fixed by using a `BufferedInputStream`, which is reset to the start after calling `isRecognizedFormat`.\n =||= Should be fixed via #531. Please try https://circle-artifacts.com/gh/JabRef/jabref/1974/artifacts/0/home/ubuntu/jabref/build/releases/JabRef-3.1dev--snapshot--2015-12-17--pull_531--53e11d4.jar\n =||= Yes, #531 fixes the issue of \"importing not functioning\". Thanks!! \n\nBTW, I would still be happy if my above enhancement suggestions would be considered :-) \n(proper key automatically generated & after closing of import window moving to or selecting imported entries)\n =||= @koppor Thanks for the fix \ud83d\ude0a It works now \n =||= "], ["480", "Entry Editor: Add tab for special fields", "Simon Harrer", "simonharrer", "02/10/17, 09:28:04 AM", "At the moment, the special fields like rank etc. can only be edited in the main table, but not in the entry editor.

Then the article numbers are used to construct a second query for the Bibtex records.

I would like to call `entry.getAuthors()` to get an `AuthorList` containing the data in a non-stringy version. \n2. There are four different modes for a type (BibTex, BibLatex and customized; or unknown). The user could switch between these modes at any time. In the ideal case, this switch would be localized in some class. The localization would make it obsolete to change the type of every entry everywhere by hand if the user switches modes.\n3. There should be a way to say that an entry has a given type (e.g. is an article) irrespective of its mode (BibTex, BibLatex, ...).\n\nI thought a little bit about these issues but couldn't come up with a solution I liked. Hopefully somebody else has a good idea to improve the system.", "I aggree, there is potential for building a more beatiful API here.\n\nRegarding 1.: Yes, maybe methods like this could be offered for all required fields that are shared by all entry types. I just fear that there is no intersection in required fields for all entry types. \n\nRegarding 2. and 3.: I think there is a misunderstanding here. The semantics of `equals` are very narrowly defined and a `BibtexEntryType` is just not equal to a `BibLatexEntryType`. This is not a \"mode\", but different instances of `EntryType`. Their contents are different. What you are talking about is the name of the entry type, which can very well be equal, regardless of whether there is a Bibtex entry or a Biblatex entry underneath. To sum up: you can say that an entry has a given _type name_ regardless of its `EntryType`. I mean something like:\n\n```\nmyBibtexEntry.getType().getName().equals(myBibLatexEntry.getType().getName()); // returns true\n```\n\ninstead of \n\n```\nmyBibtexEntry.getType().equals(myBibLatexEntry.getType()); // returns false\n```\n\nFrom what I understand, this is all that you want.\n =||= @lenhard \nDo you think it also makes sense to define such methods if the field is not defined for every entry type? For example, `Optional<AuthorList> getAuthors()`?\n\nMaybe it is not clear what I mean and it is better to view it from the other side. So the parser reads `article` in the bibfile and thus wants to assign the type article to the entry. Currently, he just puts `BibtexEntryType.Article` in it. However, this is \"wrong\" if JabRef is in Biblatex mode. On the other hand, the parser shouldn't care about biblatex mode or not. So there should be a way to say that an entry is an article without exactly specifying the mode (tex, latex, customized). I have a few solutions to this, but I'm not completely convinced by them:\n- Simply store the type as a string.\n- Store the type in an enum. This is better but I'm not sure how unknown entry types should be handled.\n- Create a class for every known entry type, e.g. `ArticleEntryType` and store this information in the entry. Then the class could encapsulate the specific mode or state through the [state design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_pattern). I like this idea the most but on the other hand it seems a little bit to complicated.\n =||= Hm, not an easy decision... If we add such methods, then using `Optional` would propably be the most reasonable solution (much better than just defining `AuthorList` as return type and potentially returning null). Since we do already have similar methods, such as `getAuthorTitleYear`, you could just go ahead and add the methods you need, from my point of view. If you implement them with `Optional`, this is already a huge improvement over the existing code. @JabRef/developers Any other thoughts on this?\n\nRegarding equality: Ok, I think I understand now. The problem is that the parser decides on the entry type based on a preference setting and before it can actually really infer the type. To infer the type, the parser would have to read the complete entry and see which fields are used. We could modify the parser to set the entry type after reading the complete entry. I just had a look at the parser code. This is not trivial, but also not too hard. Alternatively, the parser could first read the complete database and finally adjust types in a post-processing step. Ultimately, this means that it would be possible to write a database which contains bibtex and biblatex entries and it is vulnerable to a diagnosis of false-positives. Is that what we want?\n\nAlthough I personally do not like the option very much, we could also store this information in the file header (in a `@preamble`) or something similar.\n\nThe quick hack solution would be to just depend on the string (possible through `myEntry.getType().getName()`).\n\nI'm not so much in favor of creating a class for every `EntryType`. Large class hierarchies are seldom beautiful and the design principle [composition over inheritance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance) tops the state design pattern :smile:\n =||= I'm currently writing a Class to infer the type of a database.\n =||= and it is the post-processing solution that works on a `BibtexDatabase`, as far as I see. Let's try going down that road!\n =||= I'm also in favor of post-processing the entry type. But for this the entry type has to be stored in some intermediate form. And I really don't like the solution based on strings.\n =||= The `BibtexEntry` is post-processed, not its type. The type of the entry that is initially stored might be wrong (as it currently is) and would be replaced on post-processing. That would be fine by me.\n =||= I think it very much makes sense to define methods as `getAuthors()`. What is meant by the field is not defined by the entry type here? Even though they are not required nor optional, one can add any field to the entry, so just returning an empty AuthorList if the entry does not have an author-field would make sense, just as returning an empty String (or null) if your query the field \"jlijlkvjdsklj\" (most of the times).\n\nI also think it makes sense to define a `equalType`(?) method that compares the strings. In the tests I didn't really reflect on that, but was rather assuming that assumeNotEquals looked at the Java Object rather than the equals function in that case (which I now realize was a bit na\u00efve).\n\nI recently learnt that one shouldn't access `BibtexEntryType.Article` directly, but use `EntryTypes.getType(\"article\")`, see #337 . So any direct access should be replaced (unless in the tests then maybe...).\n =||= Of course, an empty `AuthorList` would be preferable to `Optional<AuthorList>`! Sometimes I am blind... However the `Optional` is preferable for return types that are not data structures or do not have a valid empty initialization. In the case of strings, the empty string would propably be fine unless it has a special meaning in `BibtexEntry`. The point is to not to add too many methods to `BibtexEntry` which will only make sense for few types. `getAuthors`, `getTitle`, etc. would propably make sense, but a `getJournal` method would make little sense for a `BibtexEntry` of type `InProceedings`.\n\nAdding an `equalType` method that uses `getType().getName()` sounds fine for me.\n =||= I have no idea how `Optional`works, so it wasn't really a comment against that. :-)\n\nProposed simple rule: methods that only return the String that is the field content are not really needed.\n =||= > So there should be a way to say that an entry is an article without exactly specifying the mode (tex, latex, customized).\n\nFrom my point of view, it doesn't matter for the parser which type an entry is. It is just a `BibEntry` with fields and a name at first. \n\nOnly when we combine this data inside a `BibDatabase` with a particular working mode (bibtex or biblatex) we can enhance the database's entries with meaningful `EntryTypes` including required and optional fields. \n\nWe also wanted to make this decision file-based, not preferences-based as it is now.\nImho, this is the direction we should go.\n =||= What is our current state regarding `entry.getAuthors()`?\n =||= "], ["496", "Main PDF Directory: and Main PS directory: preference settings removed.

If I complete both fields JabRef only accesses the User Specific file directory:!\nI insert the .bib file  fields (@simonharrer) so you can see that there are only single relative file links against each BibTeX entry.

THIS IS A VERY USEFUL CAPABILITY THAT SEEMS LOST in the current JabRef revision, and presumably could be resurrected as a new JabRef 'feature' if in the background as the \"Legacy pdf directory\" being rebadged the \"Alternative repository root directory\". I believe it is just an alternative search path added to the file search specification. Because my configuration file already has the \"Legacy pdf directory\" included it still works for me at the moment, but not if the JabRef \u2018back end\u2019 terminates what the \u2018front end\u2019 already has.\nThe ability @koppor mentions no longer is available, because it is \u2018front end\u2019 program changes that were implemented in the revision. There are probably other users that are unaware they have the issue I have raised because their files in their files in legacy locations are still found while the \u2018back end\u2019 is left alone.\n =||= So if I understand you correctly, you want to specify more then one folder in `Database Properties -> General (or user specific) file directory`, right?\nMoreover, if both the general and the user specific path are specified, then also both paths should be searched (currently only the user specific folder is taken into account). \n =||= @tobiasdiez Yes you take is absolutely correct. The very singular ability to add a \u201cUser Specified Directory\u201d that is searched if the .pdf (or other) file is not found in the \"Main file Directory\" specified. JabRef did this perfectly for me (by my miss-using the legacy pdf and ps directories setting) |Jabref Ver2.10|<Options>Preferences>External programs \"Legacy PDF Directory:\" and \"Legacy PS directory:\"), so it should not be a major recoding to reintroduce the \"Legacy pdf directory\" renamed the \"Alternative pdf file directory.\"  \nIf a user could add more than one \"Alternative file directory\" to the search file path, it would make JabRef handling of heterogeneous repositories more flexible and a real strength.  \nAt the moment it still works for me because the JabRef_Preferences.xml file still contains:\n<entry key=\"pdfDirectory\" value=\"E:\\CRC Share\\endnote\\cavitationX1.Data\\PDF\\\"/>\n<entry key=\"psDirectory\" value=\"E:\\CRC Share\\endnote\\cavitationX1.Data\\PDF\\\"/>\nThis means that |Jabref Ver3.0| still lets my install find the files with the alternative root locations. \n\nIF NOTHING ELSE COULD  THE ABILITY TO LOAD THE ABOVE VIA |Jabref|<Options>Preferences>Import preferences>\u2019JabRef_Preferences\u2019.xml be retained so I can still access this great capability (via the remaining back end support).\n =||= >  so it should not be a major recoding to reintroduce the \"Legacy pdf directory\" renamed the \"Alternative pdf file directory.\"\n\nIt's not that easy... \"legacy pdf directory\" refers to the \"legacy pdf field\" in the bib file - which stores the information in a field named `pdf` - those fields have been removed as all files regardless of the type are stored in the field `file` (not since 3.X but since earlier 2.X versions). We decided to drop support for this legacy field (and therefore also drop support for the directory configuration for those fields).\n\nPersonally, I don't like to introduce the additional configuration ability to add another \"pdf directory\" - the current configuration possibilities should be enough for (almost :wink:) every use case...\n\nWhy is this enough? \na) this is absolutely no issues if absolute paths are used - so one strategy is to use those (which might not possible if you want to use the on different machines, but:)\nb) you can use relative paths starting from the directory of the bibfile - so if you use similar folder structures on different machines your use case is still working (drawback moving the bib file around in the file system does not work)\nc) as a last fall back you can use the general, and the database-specific folders (Of course, the bug that only folder is searched must be resolved!)\n\nBut I will put this onto the agenda of our next dev call - perhaps the other developers have another opinion.\n =||= Thank's @matthiasgeiger for listing the alternative options. As I understand option a) would require me to alter thousands of file links I pulled in from an Endnote repository, which for my skill level is daunting. Option b) would break my Endnote access to the files (I think). Option c) doesn't work at the moment, but would suffice for my case if it did. It is interesting that Docear (that embeds JabRef as is bibliographic manager) is looking for ways to provide just such multi directory capability.\n\nI realise it was dropping support for field named pdf in the bib file that has withdrawn the need for  \"legacy pdf directory\" and I make no suggestion to resurrect it. The existing functionality within the 'back end' of JabRef to access the alternative repository is still in place however (It still is working for me as explained) so my comment about \"not be a major recoding\" was because I thought it was a simple matter of writing the file name \"Alternative file directory\" from a settings field into the key=\"pdfDirectory\" value=\"the directory location spec\"\nI can still do this using |Jabref ver3.0|Preferences>Import preferences>\u2019JabRef_Preferences\u2019.xml\n          <entry key=\"pdfDirectory\" value=\"the directory loction spec\"/>\n          <entry key=\"psDirectory\" value=\"the directory loction spec\"/>\n\nI saw this capability as a great feature provided by simply rebadging the key, with no suggestion of reprogramming legacy support. As usual I must be missing something and hope that this key=\"pdfDirectory\" is not deleted or my system (and I suspect other's) will be broken.\nTHX for all your time and great work, and wish I had the skill to program it myself :-). I realise you are all heavily loaded and will leave it to your wisdom.\n\nPS: I did manage yesterday to get symbolic links running on my WinDOS box so personally that is my fallback option d),  if the above functionality is taken out of the backend :-). I can send you my self-instructions on how I made symbolic links work  on Win7, if it isn't seen as \"how to suck eggs\" to a programmer as it is very easy once you implement it.\n =||= Interesting that it still works. :-) I checked the code and it is not really obvious why (but then I have no idea how it worked earlier either).\n\n\"pdfDirectory\" is only accessed when upgrading from an older version and when drag-and-dropping a PDF (this is probably not wanted by the way). fieldname + \"Directory\" is accessed in a few more places and might still add the possibility to introduce specific directories for each filetype. No idea how it works though.\n =||= Thanks @oscargus for your checking and all others who helped:-)\n\nAll I can confirm is that my repository as it stands links to  thousands of files from and Endnote repository that I connected originally using the legacy pdf field (or at least that is how I thought I made it work.). The entries in my .bib file appear thus:\n\nLegacy Endnote entry eg:  File = {://z2 A summary of exp/z2 A summary of exp.pdf:PDF},\nEntry in Main File Directory eg:  File  = {:\u00b0paper\\\u00b0misc\\fisher1942G- Geff and Mutt.pdf:PDF},\n\nBoth are located within their respective directories, that originate a different roots on the same partition (neither is a subdirectory of the other and there are no 'links' known to me). There is nothing related that I can find in my system or user variables on Win7.\n\nI now have my fall-back option d) above so won\u2019t waste more of your valuable time on this one. I REMAIN CONCERNED THAT OTHERS MAY HAVE SIMILAR WORKING HETROGENOUS FILE STRUCTURES THAT MAY BREAK IF FUTURE JABREF REVISIONS and hope it is just some setting on my instal that provides me this great functionality (I only install the latest JabRef without uninstalling, so perhaps that is why it still works).

The problem with this approach is that the parser has to know about the bibtex vs biblatex mode. The idea was to add an intermediate step:\nString (in Bibtex file) -> EntryClass (by parser) -> EntryType (by some factory using information from the preferences)\n- There is an enum `StandardEntryClass` holding all the standard types regardless of bibtex or biblatex (so article, mvbook, etc, all are there). To support also unknown entry types we have the class `NonStandardEntryClass`. So for example, parsing `@article{}` results in `class = StandardEntryClass.ARTICLE` while `@gibberish{}` yields `class = NonStandardEntryClass` with name `gibberish`. In this way the type information is stored in a relative convenient form (better then a string).\n\nThe idea of an enum implementing an interface was taken from the way java handles standard file locations. See [the oracle blog ](https://blogs.oracle.com/darcy/entry/enums_and_mixins) (or [another blog](http://blog.pengyifan.com/how-to-extend-enum-in-java/)).\n- The `EntryClass` does not know about required and optional fields.

But I think you cannot test meaningful unit tests without the robot. \n =||= For the record: Screenscraping UI test framework: http://www.sikulix.com/\n =||= I'm not sure if I like these kind of tests or not.\nOn the one hand it is of course good to increase the test coverage. Hence, the more tests the better. However, these 15% increase actually don't say anything since the tests are quite weak (there are no assertion statements??). For example, the folder \"SpecialFields\" went from 2% to 50%. Seeing these numbers, I would actually expect that the logic in these classes is relatively well-tested. But this is not the case. So the increase in code coverage actually says nothing and can be quite misleading.\n\nAdditionally, these kind of tests are rather fragile since they fail in case of trivial changes (like renaming the corresponding button). \n\nPersonally, I would wait with GUI tests until after the migration to JavaFX and until the GUI is relatively stable. For the moment, there are enough untested logic classes which should be covered first.\n =||= The thing is: with these tests we can easily spot some major issues which are hard to detect without the tests, e.g., that Swing classes are accessed outside the EDT thread or that exceptions occur upon clicking some buttons. And with only the 80 lines of code, five issues have been unearthed. Hence, the effort/benefit ratio is actually quite good. \n =||= I really want to get this through.

What is the opinion of the other @JabRef/developers ?\n =||= So, the tests are now working on travis and on circleci. The original problems were coding errors in one of the tests (which is still not working properly, but is ignored now).\n\nAs for getting the tests to work within IntelliJ, I am really at a loss.

On the other hand @tobiasdiez also has a point. When we are changing from swing to javafx, all the effort will be for nothing. So I thought about two options that we have, if we want to do ui testing anyway (and I do).\n\nThe first would be to use sikulix and screenscraping to do the tests independent from the ui-framework.\nThe thing is, when doing the conversion to JavaFX the layout might also change, but maybe using new screenshots is easier and faster then new tests.\n\nThe second solution is to try writing test interfaces that represent the use-case-flow without doing anything to the ui and in parallel write assertJ tests that use the interfaces. When converting the ui to javafx we could then still use the interfaces and only need to change the ui controlling framework. \n\nWhen we finished writing the assertJ test for #988 , @bruehldev  and I will have a look at sikulix and determine how much effort it is to write tests with it, so we can  estimate what solution is best suited for the conversion. Any opinions on my suggestions?\n =||= @Braunch  Completely agree with you.

This class has a constructor getting passed: the formatter, the filenames to test, and the extension of the input test file.\n\nThe importer code is pretty simple, because the whole logic is in MSBibDatabase.java, covered [33,87%](https://codecov.io/github/JabRef/jabref/src/main/java/net/sf/jabref/logic/msbib/MSBibDatabase.java?ref=aacca4a894c069f4efd8109b1ad486fdf80ae7d0) and MSBibEntry.java, covered [42.09%](https://codecov.io/github/JabRef/jabref/src/main/java/net/sf/jabref/logic/msbib/MSBibEntry.java?ref=aacca4a894c069f4efd8109b1ad486fdf80ae7d0).\n\nWhen I said \"neither related methods. For me, these should be tested, too.\", I meant for instance `mapMSBibToBibtexType`, which [is nearly not covered](https://codecov.io/github/JabRef/jabref/src/main/java/net/sf/jabref/logic/msbib/MSBibEntry.java?ref=aacca4a894c069f4efd8109b1ad486fdf80ae7d0#l-909).\n\nSince your project is now in the \"production\" phase and not in the warmup any more, I expect the numbers of both MSBibDatabase.java and MSBibEntry.java to raise to nearly 100%.\n =||= I tried to increase the test coverage, but the problem is, that most of the methods in the MsBibDatabse and the MsBibEntry only used in the class MSBibExportFormat. So they're not used when importing a msbib file. Is it ok to test them, when testing the MSBibExportFormat?\n =||= Yes of course you can create tests for the export and thereby test MsBibDatabse and -Entry. But please create a new test class for the exporter and don't mix it up with the tests for the importer.\n\nI think the test coverage for the importer methods is on a good level. So if you prefer we can merge this in and you open a new PR with the tests for the exporter (not sure how your project is structured).\n =||= It would fit into our plan, so I will work on the exporter test and open a new PR for the tests of the exporter. \n =||= @tobiasdiez @koppor Are you fine with merging this in?\n =||= Yes looks good to me.\n =||= "], ["509", "[WIP] Created MedlineImporterTest", null, "bruehldev", "12/20/15, 05:22:17 PM", "used an example xml file from http://www.nlm.nih.gov\ntest methods not implementet yet", "Please open WIP pull requests only if you need review during the creation of the PR to let it guide your implementation.

Right now I have issues with the converter.\n =||= `testIsRecognizedFormatAccept()` and `testImportEntriesArticle2()` are ignored because JabRef only accepts xml files with the syntax `<bibtex:\"fieldname\">`.

I thought when not using a prefix, the importer can handle the import?\n =||= No. The Importer can only import BibTeXML files with the prefix 'bibtex:'. That is one reason why the importer needs to be reimplement. For example if I convert a .bib file with an external tool to BibTeXML there is no 'bibtex:' prefix.\nNow the question why I ignore testImportEntriesArticle. Well because the importer reads all tags/fields from the BibTeXML file when using BibtexEntryAssert. Even article. So an empty field is imported but the .bib file has no article field. So there is a fail comparing the files.\n =||= So you plan a rewrite of the import logic which passes all tests in another PR, right? Normally, PRs only adding tests which are ignored should not be merged as they do not move the codebase forward - they are like a huge TODO. From my point of view, we could make an exception in that case as it is the stupro. Hence, LGTM. \n =||= I don't like that there are quite a few tests which are identical except that the type of the entry is changed. This a perfect case for a parametrized test case. Using parametrized tests also gets rid of the nearly identical test files. All of this was actually discussed in one of the recent importer PRs...\n =||= @tobiasdiez WDYT?\n =||= I still think that there are too many test files. The input can easily be created from a string and also the bibentry can be created directly. So the parametrized test should not contain a fileName as a parameter but a map XMLType -> BibTeXType.\nBut on second thought, such a map would just replicate the map present in the importer file. @koppor do you think it is worth to test each conversation to have a high test coverage? In my opinion, one conversation as a test would suffice.\n =||= I really like the test files. They could be used by other importers, too. Reason: For non-programmers this is more readable and one can really inspect whether the importing is reasonable. One does not have to read the code.\n =||= But do we need to test the conversation of each type? I would create a test that the conversation works in principle and then just have a Map<String, String> in the importer class. In my opinion there is no need to replicate this information as tests (probably you also get a high coverage with the map approach :) )\n =||= I like that each type is tested.

In #110 I identified the bibtex VM (`net.sf.jabref.bst.VM`), which can handle bsts. Seems to be very complete. I am aware that citastionstyles (see #119) is the successor of `bst` files. I am currently unsure, whether citation styles really cover all cases and if users can easily switch.\n\nIn the case of biblatex vs. citationstyles, I am pretty sure that biblatex is more powerful. When reading the documentation of [biblatex-apa](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/biblatex-apa), I don't think that a [621 line XML](https://www.zotero.org/styles/apa) can have the same functionality.

While the idea of using .bst is excellent, in this case I think it is still better to define reference style through the other definition files.\n\n(I've been thinking about generating previews using .bst, but cleaning up the .bbl is a mess in the general, or at least the IEEEtran.bst, case and the same thing is bound to happen here.

The idea was to just store the string in the BibEntry and only get the corresponding EntryType whenever it is really necessary.", "Oh, that change surely was much effort. Unfortunately, I find the old way more fitting even though the bibtex / biblatex mode switching was difficult. Why not using `EntryType`, but only as \"proxy\" to the real type dependent on the bibtex/biblatex mode? (I currently don't know the GoF pattern name for that :see_no_evil:)\n\nAll entries should have a (non-abstract) `EntryType` and there should be (abstract) `BibtexEntryType` and `BiblatexEntryType`. All of them should implement `IEntryType` offering `hasAllRequiredFields`etc. `EntryType`and `*EntryType` should not be in a inheritance relation. `EntryType` should proxy to the appropriate Bib(la)texType depending on the mode.\n =||= Thanks Olly for your feedback. \n\nLet me elaborate a little about why I've chosen to store the entry type as a String. \nThe type of the entry is per se a state-less information. `@article{}` signifies an article in the bib file independent on any preferences in JabRef. I think it it thus a good idea to also have a state-independent representation of the same information in JabRef. In other words, I prefer a system where the type is stored in the `BibEntry` class independent on anything else (much like the `author` field is also stored as a string and not as a `AuthorList` object). Then in a latter step this data can be enriched by the preference-dependent information about optional and required fields. This reflects more or less the impression I got from #495 that we came to the conclusion to see the `BibEntry` class only as a data object without any logic. \n\nNow you can think about implementing such a system in Java. The easiest way and the one I have chosen in this PR is to store the type as a String variable. One can also store the type information as an enum (as I have suggested in #501), but this feels over-engineered (especially since there is no code checking whether a entry is an article or a book). \nThe second step is to augment this information by optional/required fields. I have chosen a constructor-based approach, but maybe your idea about using the proxy pattern is better. I have to think about it more.\n =||= Regarding `String` vs `AuthorList`: I would have preferred that BibEntry uses `AuthorList`. Possibly calculated on demand and not during creation of the object. Similar for the `files` field.\n\nUnsure whether I'm wrong. I would pack as much \"interpreted\" data in BibEntry and get rid of Strings as much as possible... Maybe, we then reimplement an in-memory relational database system. For instance, if we store the \"crossref\" as reference and not as string. What if the referenced entry is deleted and then recreated etc.\n =||= Ok, as requested here a short summary in bullet list form.\n\n_Status quo_: Parser converts the string \"article\" to a BibType class instance and saves this in the entry.\n- (--) Makes changing from BibTex to BibLatex mode hard as the type stored in every entry has to be changed.\n- (-) Adds additional dependency in the parser (BibTypes class).\n- (-) The parser has to know whether we are in BibLatexMode or in BibTexMode. However, a priori this information is not necessary to parse a bib file.\n- (+) Does not store the type information as a String\n\n_PR_: Parser stores the type information as a plain string in the entry. This string will be converted to BibType class when needed\n- (+) Changing from BibTex to BibLatex mode is easier since the required/optional fields are used only in a few places. \n- (+) Makes dependencies clearer (which class needs to know the BibType or BibTex/BibLatex mode).\n- (+) Parser does not depend on BibType class and on BibLatexMode.\n- (0-) Stores the type information as a string. However, this is in my opinion no real caveat. The previous code also contains something like `if(entry.getType().getName() == \"article\")' which is now replaced by`if(entry.getType() == \"article\")`. So often the name of the BibType is used, which somehow destroys the advantage. \n\n_Alternative solution_: Store type information as an enum in the entry and convert this enum to a BibType when needed.\nThis approach keeps all the advantages but does not have the \"stringy problem\". It feels however a little bit overengineered (mainly because there are \"unknown\" types which are not covered by a simple enum)\n =||= Refs #551 \n =||= - TypedBibEntry as a wrapper around BibEntry; TypedBibEntry has high level API, BibEntry has low level API\n- TypedBibEntry -> BibEntry; BibEntry -> RawBibEntry\n =||= Rebased (not sure why there is a merge commit....) and introduced TypedBibEntry aka GoodEasyGodBibEntry (is this the correct way to implement it?). \n\nTodo (other PR): BibDatabase.getResolvedField should accept Optional database.\n =||= "], ["606", "Logic cleanup", "Oscar Gustafsson", "oscargus", "01/02/16, 10:38:08 AM", "The cleanup continues...", "NaN"], ["607", "JabRef cannot connect ot LibreOffice on Mac OS X", null, "tzvet", "01/02/16, 03:23:36 PM", "I tried to connect JabRef (latest: 3.1) to LibreOffice (latest: 5.0.2.2) on my OS X (El Capitan).

Now, while I'm writing my Phd thesis I miss one very important feature: Hierarchical Keywords\n\nI store in bibtex my keywords as: group1|subgroup1|subsubgroup1, group2|subgroup2, group3, group4|subgroup4\n\nwhere (,) is the delimiter of the keywords and (|) the delimiter of hierarchical levels. \n\nIn the current version, I can only parse regarding (,) resulting in very long keywords (which cannot be displayed as a whole). I would be very happy if somebody can implement this feature. What do you think about that? I'm willing to pay a donation, if somebody could implement it, because I have to submit the thesis in 3 month and the approx. 300 papers in my bibtex drives me to hell :)\n\nRegards,\n\nMarc", "You can use groups which can be put into a hierarchy.

I like the usage of standard file formats (like *.bib) and i like the intelligent functionality of creating groups by parsing keywords.\n\n@koppor: The short anwser is: like XMP will do that for fotos. There also exisits hierarchies like: landscape|animal|bird|parrot\n\nThe long anwser is: Beginning with scientific work (first 3 years), I started with jabref and using the keywords by IEEExplor, ACM, etc. But then, I mentioned that the keywords have noting to do with the personal point of view, evaluating a paper. Therefore, I switch to docear (2 years usage). Using the mindmap, I have exactly the structured view as I wish. The problem is, a mind map with 300+ papers is not very clear, moreover I need to use links to have a paper in 2 \"categories\". Therefore, I switched back to jabref to combine hierachies and keywords together. As I mentioned, I was inspired by XMP and image. There I heavyly use hierarchy keywords. Like the example above: a parrot is a bird, a bird is an animal, etc. I understand, that this functionality can also be applied by using 4 single keywords than using 1 hierachical: but I think it makes life easier to combine these both approachs.\n\nFrom technical side, as I understand it, the \"group by\" menu have to be extended for a second delimiter. On algorithmic view, it should be very strait forward. I tried to hack itfor myself (I'm computer scientiest but more in the hardware area), but without knowing code in detail, I will waste to much time. Therefore, I asked for help.\n\nThe conference sounds very interesting. I will check tomorrow, if there is some project with enough money for a business trip :) Otherwise, we can have a telefone call between Erlangen and Stuttgart.\n\nI hope, i could elaborate the wished feature better. Thanks again.\n =||= Thanks for your elaboration. Are you primarily talking about the groups interface (just to be clear)? I agree that it should be quite straightforward to handle it there. The \"Manage keywords\" dialog and Content selector dialog will be significantly more work, not even clear what the dialog should look like (but then it may not be required to handle anything else but strings there, at least initially).\n =||= osargus, yes, from jabref point of view, I talking about groups and how to automatically create them using bibtex fields.\n =||= Related to #705 \n\nWhile trying to unify the code to only use \",\" as a separator, this issue struck me as I saw some entries in the test bib-files that had keywords as:\n\n```\n  Keywords                 = {Action Potentials, physiology; Animals; Axons, physiology; Electrophysiology;\n Ganglia, Invertebrate, physiology; Ganglia, Sensory, physiology;\n Leeches; Neurons, physiology; Synapses, physiology; Synaptic Transmission,\n physiology},\n```\n\nMy interpretation is that this is some sort of hierarchical keywords, although it is not completely clear how the ordering is (I'd guess reversed). These keywords are supposedly generated by some database engine, so it would be nice to support it.\n\nThen, the question is: should one use this format or some other format? \n =||= I do not remember reading about it among the SourceForge feature requests, or in the survey analysis.\nDo we need to ask users if they 1) currently use hierarchical keywords and 2) if they would like to use it.\n =||= I do like the syntax `group|subgroup` suggested above. Or maybe `group>subgroup`. Preferably, the separator can be specified by the user. I'll have a look at this in the next couple of days (except somebody else wants to do it)\n =||= having hierarchical keywords would be good, indeed. I second @tobiasdiez on `group|subgroup` or `group>subgroup`. I think at some point after 2-3-5 years of usage of JabRef one has a big bibtex file with a lot of papers in it. Hierarchical keywords would allot to better organise/categorise papers. Knowing nothing about Java, i think it would also help to have some GUI for that. Maybe extend `Manage keywords` to show things as\n\n```\ngroup1\n   subgroup1\n          subsubgroup1\n   subgroup2\n          subsubgroup2\n                subsubsubgroup2\n          subsubgroup3\ngroup2\n    subgroup3\n```\n\nand allow the user to drag-and-drop the `subtrees`. For example, one should be able to drag-and-drop `subgroup2` to `group2` together with all its childs:\n\n```\ngroup1\n   subgroup1\n          subsubgroup1\ngroup2\n   subgroup2\n          subsubgroup2\n                subsubsubgroup2\n          subsubgroup3\n   subgroup3\n```\n\nThis, together with filtering capabilities IMHO would constitute a very pleasant user experience where one would be able to quickly see what tags one has and show only relevant papers. \n\nAs a continuation of this idea, it would be good to be able to assign (hierarchical) keywords to the entry from already used in the bibtex file. One could use the same visualisation above **but** only for selection of keywords for a particular paper (i.e. no renaming of keywords, changing parents for trees, etc).\n =||= With #1950 the code base is now in place to support hierarchical keywords. The following steps are needed to complete the feature:\n- [ ] Move keyword delimiter from preferences to metadata (database properties)\n- [ ] Add hierarchical delimiter and change parsing logic in `KeywordList` accordingly\n- [ ] Change UI to support hierarchical keywords\n =||= The automatic generation of new groups will be included in the next release of JabRef 4.0.

We should make it as easy as possible to use development versions so that bugs are detected as soon as possible (especially, since not all features are used by the developers).

If v3.5 dev is installed, it is checked whether v.3.5 (or later) is released. If so, a notification is shown.\n =||= I would prefer an automatic update of the dev version via install4j. We really need as much testers of the dev version as possible and thus it should be very very easy to stay up-to-date with the recent version (maybe add a mechanism that the popup is only displayed once a day or so). Also the funding argument does not apply in the case of the dev version.\n =||= install4j seems to be quite complicated to handle - @stefan-kolb can probably say something about this.

Also the review field is editable and we don't want to have editable pdf comments, so that the user won't accidentally change the comments when he doesn't want to. The pure text field of the notes and the review field can be very confusing because you can not show the comments structured in different GUI components. My alternative suggestion would be to create a special tab in the entry editor and only load the comments from the file, when the tab is opened up and not storing them into the db at all.\n =||= Sounds like a good solution, @Braunch. JabRef could internally store the extracted PDF comments if the extraction is time-consuming. But I also wouldn't write it into a BibTex field (because then you run into all kinds of synchronization problems).\n =||= If the extracted pdf comments are stored internally, this has also the advantage that the inverse functionality could be provided : if I open up a reference, and then see a comment I'm interested in, Jabref could open the pdf at the correct page in an external viewer ?

The bigger auto-bracing issue is on a different level and a discussion I've tried several times. :-) However, I do not really enjoy the behaviour that the braces are removed upon loading and added back on saving. Adding braces can be good to avoid manual work, but there's a big risk that they are added where they shouldn't and by not showing the behaviour to the user they will never understand what braces does and we will end up with incorrectly formatted reference lists.\n\nSomehow, hiding things from users and forcing them to behave correctly is good, but then it must be 100% correct and I do not think braces around capitals can ever be added automatically based on the fact that they are capitals...

Maybe it is unnoticed, but we are NOT paid for JabRef at all.\n\nIt would be very helpful if you would try to [fork JabRef](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and change the error message to \"no information about this ISBN is available from ebook.de\". The source of the homepage is available at https://github.com/JabRef/htdocs. We really need help migrating that to www.jabref.org.

Hard-coded URL in client app without my knowledge,\n2. bypassing ads shown on the web site, and \n3. Amazon\u2019s API limits.\n\n(1) won't be a problem anymore if I am kept aware of this usage. I can provide an endpoint for JabRef in addition to eBook.de that won\u2019t change, and won't try to enforce the same-origin-policy.\n(2) I don't mind offering this service for free (no ads) to JabRef users.\n(3) Amazon\u2019s API limits, unfortunately I cannot control, so as long as JabRef users stay below the Amazon API limits, this endpoint would continue to work. Once the limit is reached, users will have to wait until the restrictions are removed by Amazon (and I will provide an informative error message when that happens).\n =||= @manastungare Yes, we are very interested. Thank you for the offer! My current idea is to use your endpoint as fallback for ebook.de, if that's OK with you. Possibly, we could add a configuration option, but I currently don't see an advantage. Thereby, I assume that a data set provided by the ebook.de API is as complete as if it was requested via the Amazon API.\n =||= @koppor sorry if my capitalisation was taken as shouting at you as I realise you have correctly and effectively fixed a problem that arose:-( I did all you say, but I am not a programmer and was simply highlighting the changes I had identified would help others, not as criticism.

(Most definitely someone have defined their own magic fields...)\n =||= Preference setting:\n\n![grabbed_20160126-163648](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1366654/12585148/01c9868a-c44b-11e5-9ce8-3bd02306a26a.png)\n\n`net.sf.jabref.model.entry.EntryUtil.getSeparatedKeywords(String)`  uses `net.sf.jabref.model.entry.EntryUtil.SEPARATING_CHARS_NOSPACE`. `net.sf.jabref.model.entry.BibEntry.putKeywords(List<String>)` always uses `,`. Therefore, I would also vote to remove that configuration option and double check whether the group logic can use `EntryUtil.getSeparatedKeywords(String)`, too.\n\nRegarding `keywords` vs. other field names. The usecase is that the a user wants too keep the keywords retrieved from an external database separate from his own keywords. And therefore, he uses a new field `labels` (or similar).\n =||= I realize that #719 is not completely done yet as `getSeparatedKeywords(String)` is not changed. The group logic can use these methods, but the undo requires a bit of additional thinking...\n =||= Regarding undo/redo: I think, it is OK if we don't care in this case.\n =||= I had frustrating experiences in trying to use the dynamic groups functionality because of the comma as a keyword separator. In chemistry it not unusual to find keywords containing commas, like \"1,2-diol\" or \"1,3-dipolar cycloaddition\" or \"\u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated carbonyl\".\nActually the keyword separator is the group of characters \",\" and \" \". Indeed on importing from a RIS file, the keywords are combined in the bibtex \"keywords\" field, separated by \", \".\nI could not find a way to tell JabRef to consider a _comma not followed by a space_ as part of the keyword.\nMaybe there are users who managed to set a different keyword separator (semicolon, pipe or other character) and have their \"chemical\" keywords handled correctly. I gave up.\n =||= This could be implemented quickly. I'm unsure whether we should make that configurable. I don't know how many users use commas without space as keyword separator. Implementing some intelligence there is not worth doing as it probably will be confusing. Intelligence would be: If there are commas followed by a space in the string, use comma with space as separator. If there is not, use comma without space.\n =||= So I'm an outlier here. most likely, but I follow many libraries practice on keywords, in that multiple keywords are grouped together, with increasing specificity, and each grouping is separated by a comma. So for example, a book on China might have the following keywords:\n\n> China, government, CCP\n> China, government, dissent\n> China, society, workers\n> China, language, mandarin\n\nSuch a categorization is very helpful when searching for overlapping and macro topics, which is why LOC uses it. If a comma is enforced as a keyword separator, I suddenly have four entries of \"China\" and two of \"Government\". More importantly there is no way for me to search for the entries that \"China, government\" and \"United States, media, television\" for instances that talk about US media and the Chinese government without also getting things about the U.S. government or Chinese television.\n\nAlso, I was under the impression that you could enter keywords on separate lines, and then JabRef would automatically enter the separator in the bib file. If that is what is supposed to happen, it isn't, and if it isn't what is supposed to happen, it would make it easier to read the keywords.\n =||= Keyword separator was unified in #1950.\n =||= "], ["706", "Make bibtex and biblatex mode file-based", "Simon Harrer", "simonharrer", "01/29/16, 03:39:45 PM", "- [x] bibtex/biblatex mode is stored in the file; if it is not available, we detect (BibDatabaseTypeDetection) it and the store it\n- [x] Remove BIBTEX_MODE from preferences as it is now file-based\n- [x] File -> New must be replaced by File -> New BibTeX and File -> New BibLaTeX\n- [x]  Where can it be switched: right-click on tab\n- [x] under File -> ..., (to database separator)\n- [x] Problem: Bibtex -> New entry ...; change entry types in field editor, entry editor, ...\n- [x] menu items should adapt automatically based on currently selected tab", "I would (also) put the switch in the Database Properties dialog.\n =||= "], ["707", "Add tests checking parsing of JabRef's metadata (groups etc.)", "J\u00f6rg Lenhard", "lenhard", "11/18/16, 07:58:43 PM", "We should add tests to `BibtexParserTest` to make sure that we do not break the meta data format.", "Seems like this issue has already been fixed 8 months ago.

I think it is now time for feedback on two aspects:\n1. the save action feature itself\n2. the look of the GUI\n\nRegarding 1.: Currently, any class implementing `net.sf.jabref.logic.formatter.Formatter` can be used as a save action and can be configured for a field of any non-null and non-empty name (so you can configure actions for your custom fields). That is quite flexible. It would be trivial to extend that to `net.sf.jabref.logic.cleanup.CleanupJob`. The problem with integrating cleanup actions is that a `CleanupJob` seems to represent a batch job of cleanups that are preconfigured for certain fields. It is generally not intended to execute a `CleanupJob` for a specific and selectable field. Hence, I am not sure if cleanups and save actions go well together. A downside of the current save action feature is that save actions cannot be undone (like the sorting feature).\n\nRegarding 2.: The GUI is functional, _not_ pretty. \n![save actions](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1515701/13051416/6695bd6e-d3f9-11e5-83f7-9629616b3ede.png)\nIt has a check box to enable or disable all actions, a set of controls for adding a new action, a list for displaying actions, and a button for deleting a selected action. Do you have suggestions for a better set of controls?\n\nFinally, the layout of the controls definitely needs improvement and for some reason the size of the controls increases when adding an action. These things need to be fixed. Alas, layouting is not my favourite task...\n\nI would be grateful if someone takes a look at this and provides some feedback!", "Very nice!\nA few remarks or suggestions:\n1. For the GUI: Maybe add a line break after the checkbox, so that the controls for adding a new save actions are below the checkbox (and maybe add some indention). Write \"field\" in the textbox and delete it upon focus (similar to how the search box works). Decrease width of delete button. Besides that It is already prettier then the usual JabRef UI :smile: \n2. I think the `SaveAction` and `CleanupFormatter` classes can be merged with `FieldFormatterCleanup` (all of them essentially just store a field and a formatter). Is `CleanupFormatter` even used? Moreover, the `SaveActions.applyActionForField` method is covered by `FieldFormatterCleanup.cleanup`. Replacing `SaveAction` by `FieldFormatterCleanup` has also the advantage that the `SaveActionsPanel` can be used to add arbitrary formatters as cleanup operations in the cleanup dialog.\n =||= @tobiasdiez Thanks! `FieldFormatterCleanup` and `SaveAction` indeed seem very replaceable. I'll try to merge the two. This means I have to add implementations of `equals`, `hashCode`, and `toString` to `FieldFormatterCleanup`.\n\nI'll also try to add your remaining suggestions regarding layout and `Objects.requireNonNull`.\n =||= Ok, here's the new UI:\n![save actions2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1515701/13058425/75526b3e-d423-11e5-9463-b3277cf4c163.png)\nThe formatting changes also killed the prior resizing bug :) Any other suggestions?\n\nAs a side note: I seems that not all formatters that have been implemented have been added to the respective management classes. For instance, `net.sf.jabref.logic.formatter.bibtexfields.LatexFormatter` is not available in `BibtexFieldFormatters`. Is there a reason for that? If not, I would simply add the missing formatters, which would make them available as a save action.\n =||= Looks good to me! :+1: \n\nJust a quick note from the User perspective: This should really be explained somewhere... we need a help page and a documenation for each formatter, as they may not be as selfexplanatory as needed (e.g., the mentioned \"LatexFormatter\")\n =||= Looks good to me too! \nMaybe the display names of the formatter can be improved, but this is just a minor point.\n:+1: to merge this in.\n =||= Currently, I am displaying the formatter keys, not the display names. I'll have a look at that :)\n =||= I had a look at the formatter display names and, to be honest, they are quite bad (\"bad\" as in \"non-informative\"). The keys are much better. For instance \"TitleCaseChanger\" is better than \"Title\". Therefore, I will keep using keys for the display.\n\nAnyways, @matthiasgeiger is of course right. There is little use for this feature if it is not documented somewhere in the help files. I would suggest to do that in a separate PR, however. As far as I understand it needs to be done in another repo as well?\n\nWhen we have concluded the discussion on the meta-data format for save actions, this PR can be merged from my point of view.\n =||= The formatters are explained at http://help.jabref.org/en/CustomExports/. Section \"Built-in export formatters\". Unfortunately, we do not offer anchors to headings (see https://github.com/JabRef/www.jabref.org/issues/24).\n =||= Ok, I changed the serialization format of save actions according to the description by @tobiasdiez The new format looks like this:\n\n```\n@Comment{jabref-meta: saveActions:enabled;pages[PageNumbersFormatter,DateFormatter,]title[LowerCaseChanger,];}\n```\n\nFormatters are grouped for the fields within `[...]` and separated by commas.\n\nThe parsing logic is now considerably more complex, but for the sake of serialization beauty... :) \n\nAny other comments on the format? \n\nI have written a few more unit tests and done some manual bug testing, but it would probably be good if someone else did some manual testing, too.\n =||= Is it possible to omit the last `,`?\n =||= Nice PR! Here my few comments:\n- Why do we need the enabled flag stored in the file? For me, it is enabled if there are save actions, and disabled when there are no save actions. \n- Serialization format: we could put each field on a separate line, similarly to the groups serialization. \n- Should we provide some recommendation which save actions are sensible? Maybe something like a button that activates the recommended save actions automatically?\n- Should we translate/i10n the names of the formatters?\n =||= Ok, I have again integrated most of the remarks by @koppor, @oscargus, and @simonharrer .\n\n@koppor: Now, it is mandatory to omit the last `,`\n\nRegarding the comments by @simonharrer \n- I introduced the enable flag to mimic Eclipse save actions. Say, you want to quickly turn off save actions to do some weird testing stuff in your bib file. Without the enable flag, you have to delete your save actions. For reenabling them, you have to build all actions from scratch. The enable flag is a very easy way to take care of this.\n-  The save actions are now serialized in separate lines per field\n- A recommended set of actions sounds reasonable (we could hardcode a default set in case there is nothing configured in the file). But what kind of actions should that be? Personal preferences on that surely vary a lot, so I am quite unsure on what to recommend. Maybe we should give this some time and see which actions we use personally?\n- Formatter naming is still a mess, so I would avoid adding unnecessary translations at the moment. When we build help pages, we can come up with better formatter names and, then, introduce a translation.\n\nOnce again, the PR is ready for review and/or merge from my point of view.\n =||= if you have only one save action, the serialization looks a little bit awkward:\n\n```\n@Comment{jabref-meta: saveActions:enabled;booktitle[SuperscriptFormatter]\n;}\n```\n\nWhat about something like which would be more git-friendly\n\n```\n@Comment{jabref-meta: saveActions:enabled;\nbooktitle[SuperscriptFormatter]\n;}\n```\n\n---\n\nAnother idea for the enable-flag: you could disable all controls when the flag is disabled, so that they can only be edited if they are enabled, similar to the Eclipse settings. Would this make sense?\n\n---\n\nFor me, they do not work. Nothing is changed upon save. I use the following configuration:\n\n```\n@Comment{jabref-meta: saveActions:enabled;pages[PageNumbersFormatter]\nbooktitle[SuperscriptFormatter]\n;}\n\n@InProceedings{Pautasso2015TowardsWorkflowBenchmarking,\n  author =    {Pautasso, Cesare and Ferme, Vincenzo and Roller, Dieter and Leymann, Frank and Skouradaki, Marigianna},\n  title =     {{Towards Workflow Benchmarking: Open Research Challenges}},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 16th Conference on Database Systems for Business, Technology, and Web},\n  year =      {2015},\n  pages =     {1-20},\n  address =   {Hamburg, Germany},\n  month =     {March 2-6},\n  file =      {:Pautasso2015TowardsWorkflowBenchmarking.pdf:PDF},\n  keywords =  {benchflow}\n}\n```\n\nand the save actions should change some things in there.\n =||= The comments by @simonharrer and @tobiasdiez are implemented. \n\nNow, there are newlines in the serialization as desired and the GUI components are disabled if the checkbox is unchecked.\n\nFurthermore, an embarrasing bug discoverd by @simonharrer has been fixed and thanks to @tobiasdiez the tests look way better. \n\nOnce again, this PR is open for review.\n =||= Idea: would a TrimFormatter make sense? One that trims the value of the field? Or is this done by the serialization algorithm?\n\nDefaults:\n\n```\n@Comment{jabref-meta: saveActions:enabled;\npages[PageNumbersFormatter]\nmonth[MonthFormatter]\nbooktitle[SuperscriptFormatter]\n;}\n```\n\n I wanted to add `author[AuthorsFormatter]` as well but it has problems with author names having latex symbols in it, hence, I cannot recommend this. \n =||= I searched hard but I have nothing more to complain about :cry: \nSo :+1: for merging it in.\n\n@simonharrer Yes a trim formatter would be sensible (and it is somewhere on my idea-todo-list). \nI kind of remember that months should be just a number in BibLatex so I wouldn't recommend the MonthFormatter (in BibLatex mode). \n =||= It is pretty annoying if you add a save action, then see what it did (as there is no documentation, and even with documentation, you probably want to try it out) and you cannot make it reverse, only using version control. Before this is released, we need an undo functionality, I think. \n\nInstead of a documentation, we could simply define a few \"test strings\" per formatter which can be returned with an additional getter in the `Formatter` interface, and present them as well as their result on calling the formatter in the UI to display what a formatter is doing. \n\nMaybe using the `JSearchTextField` would be a little bit nicer for the UI, as it automatically shows text and when the focus is removed and the field is empty, this text is shown again. You could use something like `enter field, e.g., title or author`. We could rename `JSearchTextField` to something without search in its name and move it to a ui util package. \n\nWith save actions, we need to ensure that if we call them twice (save again), they add more stuff. This should be tested somehow, as otherwise, users will complain. Maybe use the same example strings used as a documentation replacement?\n\nDuplicate entries can occur in the UI, e.g., I can add pages[PagesNumberFormatter] multiple times. Upon close, this is cleaned up. Could be left as it is, I think. Just a remark from my side. \n\nIcons (+, -) could be used instead of the text on the buttons. \n =||= I'd like to sum up what needs to be done to get this PR merged:\n- _Undo functionality_: In principle, this is supported. The `SaveActions` use `FieldFormatterCleanup` and I can easily return a `List<FieldChange>` upon applying save actions, like for the cleanup functionality. Just how should an undo be integrated here? How can that be integrated with `BibDatabaseWriter`? As far as I know, JabRef currently cannot undo a save operation. How should that be achieved?\n- _Better text field_: @simonharrer Can you refactor the `JSearchTextField` as you described, so I can use it for save actions?\n- _Duplicate detection_: I can add a duplicate check when adding save actions.\n- _Button icons_: This should be a trivial change in `SaveActionsPanel`. I'll look for something.\n =||= @lenhard see 702913bed084ce3684db337320bf3b801f3cca96 for the refactored text field\n =||= Again, the things I stated above are implemented and, hopefully, this can soon be merged.\n\nJust a few remarks:\n- Personally, I like the text \"Add\" and \"Delete\" better than the Icons that are displayed now, but whatever...\n- Undoing save actions after save works via the menu Edit -> Undo. For some reason the key binding CTRL + Z does not trigger an action after save. I consider this a bug that should be fixed outside of this PR.\n =||= - Strange side effect: if I add save actions, the save sort order is added as well. I just enabled the save actions, and this was added:\n\n```\n+@Comment{jabref-meta: saveOrderConfig:original;;false;;false;;false;}\n+\n+@Comment{jabref-meta: saveActions:enabled;\n+pages[PageNumbersFormatter]\n+;}\n+\n```\n- Removing all save actions and disabling it does not remove them from the file. \n\n```\n+@Comment{jabref-meta: saveOrderConfig:original;;false;;false;;false;}\n+\n+@Comment{jabref-meta: saveActions:disabled;;}\n+\n```\n\nEven when they are enabled but have no configuration, they are stored.\n\n```\n+@Comment{jabref-meta: saveOrderConfig:original;;false;;false;;false;}\n+\n+@Comment{jabref-meta: saveActions:enabled;\n+;}\n+\n```\n\nI propose to only store them if they are really used. Otherwise, nothing should be stored in the bib file. \n\nAnd the serialization format changes if save actions are enabled or disabled, as shown in the examples above.  \n =||= And it's implemented.\n\nI guess this PR will never end, will it? ;-)\n =||= Mhhh... maybe it is better to apply the save actions not in the DatabaseWriter but in another place (savesession?). Because of separation of concerns and so... What do you think? \n(I would also remove the `undoable` prefix in the field changes name. The field changes are apriori just a list of changes and have no ability to be reverted. The revert functionality is added by the UndoableFieldChange class) \n =||= Could you also please add the TrimFormatter and RemoveBracesFormatter from #853. Thanks!\n =||= Once more, the above comments are implemented and this PR is ready for review. Discussion points:\n- I added the default actions as recommend by @simonharrer \n- @tobiasdiez Regarding the relocation of the application the save actions: I am not convinced why `SaveSession` would be a better place for applying the save actions. Right now `SaveSession` is more of a storage object for information regarding a save. If we integrate the application of save actions, `SaveSession` would need to know about `BibEntry`, which it currently doesn't. Moreover, the `BibDatabaseWriter` also resorts the entries, so why not apply the save actions there? It also requires the application of save actions before writing. All in all, I currently could not find a better place for applying save actions, but I am still open for suggestions.\n- I took the liberty to implement a new feature: I you choose `all` as field name in the save actions, the selected formatter will be applied to all fields of all entries in the database. Say you want to always trim all fields, this sounded useful. However, the `TrimFormatter` in its current fashion does not work, since `BibEntry.getField` for some reason returns a trimmed version of the field content regardless of the content of the GUI. But that is a bug unrelated to this PR, which _won't_ be fixed in this PR.

By using Unicode escaping it is claimed that it works anyway.\nWhat that means in practice I'm not really sure about.\n\nI also notes that the Japanese translation used UTF-8 without any problems,\nso I cannot say that I fully understand it...\n =||= My Notepad++ says that all those files are saved in UTF8 (regardless what the comment says) - but russian was the only one not saved with \"UTF8 without BOM\".\n =||= OK! I changed the encoding properties in Eclipse and then it worked, but\nclearly the diff was quite small... Maybe my edit in the Wiki was a bit\nquick...\n =||= Ok, then can this be merged?\n\nBtw. we use a custom written class which enables loading properties files encoded in UTF8 instead of the default ISO.... \n =||= OK! I just checked the test class and there it seemed to use the standard\nreader.\n\nSince the tests pass I strongly believe that it can be merged now.\n\nOne should probably try to use the Russian translation on various platforms\nto fully confirm that no problems occurred as quickly as possible.\n(However, based on the minimal diff for the final commit I cannot really\nsee what could have happened.)\n =||= Hm, then the test class should use the UTF-8 reader as well. \n =||= The difference is (if I understand the code correctly), in the tests the files is loaded with `properties.load(is)`, i.e. a `Properties`-method to obtain a `Map` while in the actual translation a `ResourceBundle` is used.\n\nI changed the properties.load now to use a Reader with UTF-8 and as far as I can read up this is what ResourceBundle eventually use: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4659929/how-to-use-utf-8-in-resource-properties-with-resourcebundle\n\nHowever, when working on #994 Eclipse all of a sudden decided to use Unicode escaping...\n =||= I added escaping for # and ! as well (a bit annoying is we happens to use the translation string `\"#mon# undefined\"` and it ends up to be a comment...).\n\nI can also confirm that with the current format of the ru-files it works fine on my Windows 7 laptop.\n =||= I suppose it has sth do to with the Python script not reading the files in UTF8:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/10971033/backporting-python-3-openencoding-utf-8-to-python-2\nAnd I strongly would advise to let the properties files in UTF8, makes work for the tranlators easiert.\n =||= No, nothing to do with Python. I think @matthiasgeiger s comment about \"UTF8 without BOM\" is the key thing here. (And no, the comment has nothing to do with it, not sure why it is there...)\n\nI quite sure that the Russian files are indeed saved as UTF-8 now as well (based on the small final diff). #994 is a bit more doubtful though... Either way, good editors will handle it transparently, but we should probably wait before merging #994.  \n =||= I've found a good way to actually store the files in UTF-8, even those that are now mixed (like the French translation). See the latest commit. Should I go ahead and convert all files?\n =||= Maybe @JabRef/translators should state their opinion here. Since [popeye](https://github.com/JabRef/popeye) works perfectly, I would see no reason for keeping outdated encodings.\n =||= For me, files can be converted.\n =||= +1\n =||= Please also add a gradle task to call the new functionality\n =||= It is already done. The (easiest) solution was to do both adding new and\nremove obsolete in the same command.

ReadWriter?]\n  - pro: encapsulation of responsibilities (but weaker as 1), can be reused somewhere else, better testability\n  - contra: exposes writing and parsing to the outside world, many new classes\n- The corresponding objects have methods which allow parsing and converting to string.\n  - e.g.: Metadata has static parse(String stringyMetadata) [or constructor?] and serialize()\n  - pro: encapsulation of responsibilities (but weaker as 1 and 2), can be reused somewhere else, better testability as 1\n  - contra: exposes writing and parsing to the outside world, scatters parsing and writing logic \n\nI have no strong opinion about which option we should use (slightly preferring 2), but we should decide for _one_ to handle parsing and writing uniformly.

I can say that it is feasible to extract this logic. Currently, it is quite localized in private methods in the parser and writer and we should be able to move it without too much effort. The difficult part about serializing `MetaData` is that every tag has very specific serialization conventions which requires a lot of if/elseif structuring. Moreover, I don't think this will require a lot of new classes.

However, these are common attributes bibliographic styles need to support to be fully complient. Can this functionality be added to jstyle files and implemented across the JabRef-LibreOffice interface?\n\nI am thinking of there being a couple of attributes added to the CITATION section of jstyle files. Maybe one called, \"LineSpacing\", and another called, \"HangingIndent\" (whether in inches or millimeters is fine, as long as its specified somewhere). I have found that when I want to submit a paper, journals have very specific ideas about how they want citations set out.

Our product transitions into being more well-structured in terms of code quality but does not focus much on improving usability for the end users.\n- We should not unecessarily increase the number of formatters, but limit our range to \"good\" formatters\n- Formatters should have a clear use case that is applicable for a wider range of users, not obscure use cases for individuals\n- The use case and functionality must be clear to the user. So what to expect from the formatter? e.g. a Unitformatter does not state which units it will apply to\n- Formatters should be well tested and be applicable for (almost) all cases that may apply, e.g. a html formatter capable of formatting only <b> text as \\textbf{} makes no sense.\n\nTherefore, I propose to remove/improve the following formatters:\n- [ ] AuthorsFormatter: needs to be improved to be able to handle at least Latex umlauts, e.g. J{\"o}rg\n- [ ] UppercaseChanger: Remove this formatter. I don't see any use case where I want to upcase my fields\n- [ ] CaseKeeper: Which terms are frozen?\n- [ ] TrimFormatter: We should trim() all fields in the entry by default. I don't see any reason why one wants to have spaces at the beginning or end of an BibTex field.\n- [ ] HTMLToLatexFormatter: What cases can this formatter handle? It's unclear to the user. I don't think it is good enough to stay in the game.\n- [ ] UnitFormatter: what units can this formatter convert? It's unclear to the user. I'd remove it or implement ALL standard LaTeX units, if there is such a list.\n- [ ] UnicodeToLatex: Is it good enough? What cases does it handle?\n\nComments and changes welcome!\n =||= @JabRef/developers As this is a blocker for v3.3 (especially the keys for avoiding migrations later on) all of you should have a look.\n =||= @stefan-kolb Have your tried the HTML/Unicode to Latex (or back, layout formatters) converters recently? :-) \n\nI'd say it is probably the best/most complete open source converter suite available (beaten only by Latex when it comes to Latex to Unicode...).\n\nThe unit converter handles all SI units and quite a lot of derived ones. Would be a shame to remove it as it provides automatic proper formatting for quite a lot of cases.\n\nCase keeper is very EE focused at the moment (since I wrote it and probably has been the only one adding words and abbreviations to it). Since IEEE now provide quite OK bracing, the need is reduced for it. Still, I'd say keep and later make it configurable for people to add their own words. To automatically be able to add braces to the correct words (as opposed to all capital letters) is far superior. Even after running some case converter.\n\nThe authors formatter should use one of the two already existing, far superior, methods to format names. Author list or even better the one in bst. \n\nIn general, usability is quite user dependent. There are a few for matters I will never ever use and a few which you have rendered useless that I use regularly...\n =||= @oscargus Like I said I'm open for suggestions. I'd just took a look from a customers point of view at first. Haven't evaluated the code of each Formatter.\n =||= So what about UppercaseChanger and TrimFormatter at least?\n =||= I think the UppercaseChanger can be removed. The only application I see is that this formatter is used in the generation of cite-keys, where it might make sense (but again, then this is not a Formatter but a LayoutFormatter).\n\nRegarding the TrimFormatter So far we had the \"don't change the contents of the fields until asked to do so\"-policy. On the other hand, I find it reasonable to always trim the field contents. \n =||= My following list is based on Simon's. Additionally, I also did some sorting and also did add classnames\n\nI like the CamelCase key names, therefore I put CamelCase there.\n\nRegarding the name: I think, it reads strange, if we have a name with two words and the first word is sometimes capitalized and sometimes not. Therefore, I write everything in lower case.\n\nQuestions:\n\nRegarding FreezeTerms and UnfreezeTerms: This are no opposite formatters. Therefore, I included \"UnfreezeWords\". Maybe \"UnfreezeAllWords\" would be better?\n\nI really vote for keeping AuthorsFormatter as it is a different thing than AuthorList and is more powerful. See #950.\n\nUpperCaseChanger: We can convert them to a LayoutFormatter.\n\nTimFormatter: +1 for always trimming during writing an entry.\n\n## Authors related\n- [ ] AuthorsFormatter\n  - classname: NormalizeAuthorsFormatter\n  - key: NormalizeAuthors\n  - name: normalize authors\n  - description: Normalizes lists of persons in %s to the BibTeX standard. \n  - example: \"Albert Einstein and Alan Turing\" to \"Einstein, Albert and Turing, Alan\"\n- [ ] AuthorsMinifier\n  - key: minify_authors\n  - classname: MinifyAuthorsFormatter\n  - example: \"Stefan Kolb and Simon Harrer and Guido Wirtz\" to \"Stefan Kolb and others\"\n\n## Date related\n- [ ] MonthFormatter\n  - classname: NormalizeMonthFormatter\n  - key:  NormalizeMonth\n  - name: normalize month\n  - example: \"December\" to \"#dec#\"\n- [ ] DateFormatter\n  - classname: NormalizeDateFormatter\n  - key: NormalizeDate\n  - name: normalize date\n  - example: \"1.1.16\" to \"2016-01-01\"\n\n## Page related\n- [ ] PageNumbersFormatter\n  - key: NormalizePages\n  - classname: NormalizePagesFormatter\n  - name: normalize pages\n  - example: \"1 - 2\" to \"1--2\"\n\n## Casing related\n- [ ] TitleCaseChanger\n  - key: <s>titelize</s> EnforceTitleCase\n  - name: <s>Titelize</s> EnforceTitleCaseFormatter\n  - description: Capitalize all words in %s, but converts articles, prepositions, and conjunctions to lower case.\n  - example: \"{BPMN} conformance In open source ENgines\" to \"{BPMN} Conformance in Open Source Engines\"\n- [ ] UpperEachFirstCaseChanger\n  - classname: CapitalizeFormatter\n  - key: Capitalize\n  - name: capitalize\n  - example: \"I have {a} DREAM\" to \"I Have {a} Dream\"\n- [ ] UpperCaseChanger\n  - classname: UpcaseFormatter\n  - key: upcase\n  - name: to upper case\n  - example: \"Google {Chrome}\" to \"GOOGLE {Chrome}\"\n- [ ] UpperFirstCaseChanger\n  - classname: CapitalizeFirstDowncaseOthersFormatter\n  - key: CapitalizeFirstDowncaseOthers\n  - name: capitalize first, downcase others\n  - example: \"i have {Aa} DREAM\" to \"I have {Aa} dream\"\n- [ ] LowerCaseChanger\n  - classname: DowncaseFormatter\n  - key: Downcase\n  - name: to down case\n  - example: \"Google {Chrome}\" to \"google {Chrome}\"\n- [ ] CaseKeeper\n  - class: FreezeTermsFormatter\n  - key: FreezeTerms\n  - name: freeze terms\n  - example: \"In CDMA\" to \"In {CDMA}\"\n- [ ] RemoveBracesFormatter\n  - key: UnfreezeWords\n  - name: unfreeze words\n  - example: \"In {CDMA}\" to \"In CDMA\"\n\n## LaTeX conversion\n- [ ] LatexFormatter\n  - classname: RemoveLatexFormatter\n  - key: RemoveLatex\n  - name: remove LaTeX\n  - desc: removes all latex constructs and code in %s.\n  - example: \"\\textbf{asdf}\" to \"asdf\"\n- [ ] HTMLToLatexFormatter\n  - key: HTMLToLaTeX\n  - name: HTML to LaTeX\n  - classname: HtmlToLatexFormatter\n  - example: \"<strong>asdf</strong>\" to \"\\textbf{asdf}\"\n  - usage?\n- [ ] UnicodeToLatexFormatter\n  - key: UnicodeToLatex\n  - name: Unicode to LaTeX\n  - classname: UnicodeToLatexFormatter\n  - example: \"M\u00f6nch\" to \"M\\\"{o}nch\"\n- [ ] SuperscriptFormatter\n  - key: OrdinalsToLatex\n  - classname: OrdinalsToLatexFormatter\n  - name: ordinals to LaTeX\n  - example: \"11th\" to \"11\\textsuperscript{th}\"\n- [ ] UnitFormatter\n  - key: UnitsToLatex\n  - classname: UnitsToLatexFormatter\n  - name: Units to LaTeX\n  - Add hard spaces, non-breaking hyphen, and freezing to units\n  - example: \"1 Hz\" to \"1~{Hz}\"\n\n## Radical formatters\n- [ ] TrimFormatter\n  - key: trim\n  - maybe remove this? to be discussed in devcall?\n- [ ] EraseFormatter\n  - key: clear\n  - name: Clear\n  - classname: ClearFormatter\n  - example: \"Anything\" to \"\"\n =||= We have to be sure, what `UnicodeToLaTeX` does.

(by the way, the new class should live in `logic`)\n-  now you want to achieve 100% coverage, so you need to change the OS in your tests.

AFAIK, there isn't even one for JabRef's XML. Therefore, I propose that we should use [BibTeXML ](http://bibtexml.sourceforge.net/) only and migrate old XMP meta data to the BibTeXML format.\n\nXMP examples can be found at https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/fc82796f1f99c00a01ccdb9dd4fff792a40b7e75/src/test/java/net/sf/jabref/logic/xmp/XMPUtilTest.java#L139.", "Refs #898\n =||= I'm not really following the argumentation. One may argue of different export formats, but how is it relevant that they are both XML? Isn't it more of an issue if it is a relevant format in itself?\n =||= Context: The format is used for storing BibTeX data in XML files using the XMP functionality (follow `net.sf.jabref.logic.xmp.XMPSchemaBibtex`). This PDF meta data is used by other people to exchange PDFs with the correct bibliographic data without being forced to send the bib entry along with the PDF in two files.\r\n\r\nI am arguing that JabRef uses a proprietary format which is not used elsewhere. Thus, our XMP data cannot be processed by other software. I see the point, that the last commit at the [current BibTeXML repository](https://github.com/Zearin/BibTeXML) is from 2011. Nevertheless, I vote for joining forces. These formats are too similar to go into different directions.\r\n\r\nI see following alternatives:\r\n\r\n1. Replace JabRef's bibteXMP by the canonical bibtex representation\r\n2. Completely use RDF. There seem multiple BibTeX2RDF converters available: https://www.w3.org/wiki/ConverterToRdf#BibTex\r\n3. Maybe, OWL is also an option: http://zeitkunst.org/bibtex/0.1/\r\n4. Move to BiBTeXML (as outlined in the original issue)\r\n4. Use [MODS](http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/)\r\n5. Keep everything as is\r\n\r\nSomehow, the current code seems to use \"[Dublin Core](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin_Core)\", which reads good. Maybe, that code can just be used and the other serialization using `{http://jabref.sourceforge.net/bibteXMP/}bibtex` can be removed completely. Needs to be investigated further.\r\n\r\nIn case everything is replaced by Dublin Core, one can update PDFBox - see https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/1096.\r\n =||= Ah, OK, so bibteXMP is JabRef's own format? Then it clearly makes more\nsense so not support exporting in that.\n =||= The question would be: How many people actually use the XMP feature?\nFrom my point of view I would suggest supporting the BibteXML Format and maybe add the RDF/OWL stuff as an addition. \nInterestingly there is also a Paper about BibtexML:\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/2564256_BIBTEXML_An_XML_Representation_of_BIBTEX\n\nFrom a quick look at the Code you referenced, I saw that it uses rdf-Tags...:confused:\n =||= The XMP feature is _the_ central tool to distribute PDFs with bibliographic information. I learned it from [Adrian Daerr](http://www.msc.univ-paris-diderot.fr/~daerr/index_de.html) (possibly @adriandaerr?).\n\nI am also confused by the code and also had the strange feelings about nesting JabRef's bibtexml into rdf tags. Therefore, I proposed to focus on Dublin Core  (see above).\n =||= thanks for inviting me to the discussion! the BibTeXML we developed and implemented (http://dret.net/netdret/publications#wil01e) is a different one than the sourceforge repo. the paper is from 15 years ago, and while we used the language in a later project (http://dret.net/projects/sharef/), the software produced by that project is not really used anywhere, as far as i can tell. i did hand the sources to some people who liked it and wanted to have a bibtex-xml converter, but i don't think anybody ever made their versions public. i think our XML schema was pretty well-desgined, but it's something i haven't looked at in quite a while.\n =||= Either format you prefer to embed in PDF, would be great if it is compatible with PDF/A compliance checks.\nJabRef 2.x embeds caused errors like:\n\n> XMP metadata property used, which is not predefined in the XMP specification of January 2004. There is no XMP extension schema present in the PDF defining the use and contents of this property. Some PDF-based ISO standards require that all XMP metadata properties are either predefined or defined in an embedded extension schema.\n\nIf it will be format like BibteXML, that can be exported in xml it would be also great to have some minimal example for correct embedding it through latex with [`xmpincl`](http://ctan.org/pkg/xmpincl) or [`hyperxmp`](http://ctan.org/pkg/hyperxmp) packages. Use case: compiling thesis with embeded metadata precomposed with JabRef.\n =||= After dealing with this in #1096 I think the most portable solution would be to drop the JabRef bibteXMP and to encode everything into Dublin core (which we already do on top of our custom serialization).\n\nThat is, if we do not decide to drop the XMP functionality completely.\n =||= Some info about correct storage of xmp inside pdf (to be compatible with pdf/a for example) can be found with samples at http://www.pdflib.com/knowledge-base/xmp-metadata/xmp-in-pdfa/\nHere goes free xmp validator: http://www.pdflib.com/knowledge-base/xmp-metadata/free-xmp-validator/\nSome java code samples can also be found at that website.\n =||= Idea (as discussed with @hummelriegel): Add bibtexs of cited entries to the PDF.

We should go in this direction. =||= Refs https://github.com/koppor/jabref/issues/6 =||= Hi guys. I am not developer. I am just another user. I really hope that you **maintain the XML feature**. This one of the most important unique feature of Jabref that keep me come back time and time again (after using great reference manager like Bookends). The XML is useful not just for sharing Pdf files. **Embedding the information into the Pdf is very useful for powerful search tools like Deveonthink[Mac], Spotlight[MaC], dtSearch[Windows].** With the embedded data, it is possible to search Pdf files by their author, title and the like data. In addition, re-generating the Jabref library from the pdf files (incase the library is corrupted or deleted) is possible with the embedded data. I had a couple of cases where my pdf files get dissociated from the reference. I drag them back. Voil\u00e0, I have the whole reference. This is just so great.  =||= Hi dellu. Thanks for the praise! And no worries, we have no intentions of removing support for this feature. Quite the contrary, we would like to update and improve it. Unfortunately, this has so far failed due to issues in the libraries that we use for this functionality. As a result, I assume that there will be no significant changes here in the near future. =||= Thank you @lenhard. I am glad you are going to keep the feature. \r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think of [this](http://www.molspaces.com/d_cb2bib-metadata.php) ?\r\nThey also write the metadata into the file using ExifTool. They use the standard bibtex tags. The standard Bibtex is  nice.  =||= @Dellu \r\n\r\nInteresting link, thanks! Unfortunately, it will not be easy to interact with that tool or the ExifTool. The former is written in C++ and the latter in Perl, whereas JabRef is written in Java. There is always a way around the language differences, but in my point of view we should stick to the Java ecosystem and build a JabRef where everything is closely integrated and without language-related friction.\r\n\r\nOther developers might have a different opinion, though. =||= Together with @snisnisniksonah I am investigating whether we can use Dublin Core.\r\n\r\nCurrent steps:\r\n\r\n1. Read/write PDF annotations using Dublin Core using PDFBox 2.x (refs https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/1096)\r\n2. Extract command line tool to convert old PDF annotations to the new format (Refs https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/266#issuecomment-151827312) -> XMPUtil will released separately.\r\n\r\nResults:\r\n- JabRef 4.x depending on PDFBox 2.x\r\n- XMPUtils depending on PDFBox 1.x\r\n =||= Nice! I think the XMPUtil is not that important since in most cases you can just write the information again to the PDF using Dublin Core and thus overwriting / \"converting\" the old XMP data. =||= Note to self: Do not forget https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/938#issuecomment-232652848. pdflatex can easily do that: [authorarchive](https://github.com/adbrucker/authorarchive).

I thought that the undo/redo concept of JabRef is that always undo and redo actions are packaged as a whole.\n\nIs it a valid workaround to globally flag whether an redo/undo action is in progress and thus no new undo thing is put on the undo stack.\n =||= I would also prefer that the undo stuff is fixed so restoring several bibentries works. \n =||= But good that you found out the reason for the failing multiple entries! :+1:\n =||= OK, I'll look further into it and search for a better solution!\n =||= @bartsch-dev can you point me to the code where the insertion adds a new change in the undomanager? As far as I see, the revert action just calls database.insert() which does not call the undo manager. Thanks.\n =||= When an entry is about to being restored [`UndoableRemoveEntry#undo()`](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/master/src/main/java/net/sf/jabref/gui/undo/UndoableRemoveEntry.java#L62) is called.\nThe entry is inserted back into the database which fires a [`DatabaseChangeEvent`](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/master/src/main/java/net/sf/jabref/model/database/BibDatabase.java#L185) and calls [`SpecialFieldDatabaseChangeListener#databaseChanged(DatabaseChangeEvent e)`](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/master/src/main/java/net/sf/jabref/specialfields/SpecialFieldDatabaseChangeListener.java#L25) and adds another Edit into the `undoManager`.\nIf we follow that trail we see that the `UndoManager` trims the Edits (line 502) which calls `die()` (line 244) and kills the `NamedCompound`which contains the other entries we haven't undone yet.\n =||= I wonder whether it is a solution to add a second paramter to `insertEntry` indicating whether the action should be a silent change or not. - Or add a second method `insertEntrySilently`.\n =||= Thank you @bartsch-dev for you helpful explanation! I think the cleanest way is to remove the `SpecialFieldDatabaseChangeListener` and let the calling code handle the undo-management. I.e. if I call database.insert() then I also have to create the undo event there. Otherwise we have problems everywhere with handling multiple changes (undo an import?). I think this strategy is also applied everywhere else, at least the group interface handles the undo thing itself.\n\nBut maybe you come up with another solution.\n =||= When removing the `SpecialFieldDatabaseChangeListener`, it should be taken care that the special fields still work. \n\nCurrently, the fields are stored in the keyword field and are put into normal fields to enable rendering in the table. If the `SpecialFieldDatabaseChangeListener` is removed, this rendering IMHO won't take place any more.\n\nWhen we rewrite the special fields (https://github.com/koppor/jabref/issues/84), this might change.\n =||= Another working solution I found was to create a new `UndoableEdit` which manages multiple Entries with a List. When undoing the removal it uses the new `addEntries()`-Method inside `BibDatabase` which adds all the Entries and after that finally fires the DatabaseChanges.\n =||= @koppor @tobiasdiez WDYT?\n =||= As I explored deeper into the code I noticed that the Undo which the `SpecialFieldDatabaseChangeListener` adds doesn't do anything. Basically it's an empty `NamedCompund` (which gets discarded by the `UndoManager`).\n\nCan that confirm anyone?\n =||= Currently without code here. But double check that the stars in the column\nrating are displayed in all undo cases. Deleting/adding an entry is OK, but\nwhat about undo/redo of adding keyword \"rank1\" in the keyword field? - My\nfeeling is that undo/redo if that won't work when the updatelistener is\nchanged.\n\nAlso if an entry with keyword \"rank1\" is added -> is the column \"ranking\"\nupdated to show one star?\n =||= The [`SpecialFieldDatabaseChangeListener`](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/master/src/main/java/net/sf/jabref/specialfields/SpecialFieldDatabaseChangeListener.java#L18) only reacts on the insertion of entries.\n\nOn another note, when changing the rank of an entry you have to click into the Entry List to repaint it. But I think there was opened an Issue on that a short time ago.\n =||= I deleted the `SpecialFieldDatabaseChangeListener` and adjusted l10n.\nAs far as I can tell everything works just fine (tested it with deleting/undoing entries with rank/marked/color marked; @tschechlovdev maybe you can do some additional testing?).\nI removed the ID generation in `UndoableRemoveEntry` since its not necessary.\n\nI have NO idea why circleCI fails and how to fix it.\n =||= ```\n:compileJava/home/travis/build/JabRef/jabref/src/main/java/net/sf/jabref/gui/BasePanel.java:1324: error: cannot find symbol\n\n        database.addDatabaseChangeListener(SpecialFieldDatabaseChangeListener.getInstance());\n\n                                           ^\n\n  symbol:   variable SpecialFieldDatabaseChangeListener\n\n  location: class BasePanel\n```\n\nShould be quite obvious what is wrong and not be that hard to fix?!\n =||= Woops, I slipped there. I extracted some code for another Bugfix which will get its own PR and extracted too much.\nNow all checks pass but before that the build on circleCI exceeded the memory of 4G (no typing error, but I think circleCI meant 4GB) and failed.\n =||= LGTM :+1:\nIts nice that a bug can be fixed by removing code.\n =||= Special fields functionality is disturbed by this patch.\n\n## Steps to reproduce\n1. open [special-fields.bib](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/master/src/test/resources/testbib/special-fields.bib)\n2. double click on second entry (key: entry-with-rank2)\n3. Go to \"BibTeX source\"\n4. Copy the complete string into notepad++\n5. Close the entry editor\n6. Change `rank2` to `rank4` in both the key and the keywords field\n7. Mark everything\n8. Copy into the clipboard\n9. Focus JabRef. Ensure that the entry editor is really closed\n10. Click into the white area\n11. paste the entry (using ctrl+v)\n12. expected: four stars shown at ranking column; as is: no stars shown at ranking column\n\n![grabbed_20160412-083537](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1366654/14451731/8d057f68-0089-11e6-898b-60117395ad0c.png)\n\n## Intermediate solution\n1. Open the editor\n2. Go to the \"General\" tab\n3. Change `rank4` to `rank3`\n4. Save\n5. Change `rank3` to `rank4`\n\n## General remarks\n\nI know that the keyword-based synchronization is a code which is not that straight forward as other code in JabRef. I personally like the functionality to have columns shown which are based on keywords I made. The reason might be that I sometimes edit my bibtex files manually, which also [nearly half of the survey participants do](http://www.jabref.org/surveys/2015/analysis).\n =||= Thanks for that detailed explanation.\n\nIMO the addition of the Undo-Object in [`SpecialFieldDatabaseChangeListener`](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/master/src/main/java/net/sf/jabref/specialfields/SpecialFieldDatabaseChangeListener.java#L25) is not useful.\nMostly because its added before the more important Undo-Object, the undo of the entry paste, and when you undo the paste this undo-Object is irrelevant. \n =||= @bartsch-dev Could you add an integrationTest, meaning a test for the UI demonstrating the undo/redo behavior? Then, we don't have to rely on the [above manual steps](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/947#issuecomment-208730863) for testing. @bruehldev and @Braunch should be the experts in UI testing.\n =||= I'll do it it the next sprint, which starts today.\n =||= ## [Current coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/JabRef/jabref/pull/947?src=pr) is **27.55%**\n\n> Merging [#947](https://codecov.io/gh/JabRef/jabref/pull/947?src=pr) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/JabRef/jabref/branch/master?src=pr) will decrease coverage by **-0.91%**\n\n``` diff\n@@             master       #947   diff @@\n==========================================\n  Files           700        695     -5   \n  Lines         46231      46292    +61   \n  Methods           0          0          \n  Messages          0          0          \n  Branches       7631       7649    +18   \n==========================================\n- Hits          13158      12753   -405   \n- Misses        31949      32439   +490   \n+ Partials       1124       1100    -24   \n```\n1. 5 files (not in diff) in `.../net/sf/jabref/event` were deleted.

Having two classes essentially doing the same thing fells redundant. So I would propose that you now add all the functionality of the old formatter to the PersonList class to fix the tests.\n =||= @tobiasdiez I think, your suggestion is done at f8d33fd7e9ae93766b036fc51db6d0967d09e75b. I assume you meant `AuthorList` as there is no `PersonList`.\n\nI discovered `net.sf.jabref.logic.mods.PersonName`, which also does some magic parsing, but not as magic as `net.sf.jabref.logic.formatter.bibtexfields.AuthorsFormatter.format(String)`.\n\nWith my screenshot above, I wanted to highlight that AuthorsFormatter is trying to _fix_ names.\n\nIf I get you right, you talk about usecase \"1)\". AuthorsFormatter is mainly for usecase \"2)\". This demonstration PR makes AuthorsFormatter to fulfill usecase \"1)\".\n\nFor an import of data, for example via [FreeCite](http://freecite.library.brown.edu/), the authors have to be post-processed. (use-case 2)). \n\nMaybe, the current AuthorsFormatter should be called `ArbitraryPersonsToBibtexPerons`? And a new formatter `NormalizePersons` should be introduced. The NormalizePersons is also available as save action, but the ArbitraryPersonsToBibtexPerons is not. This does too much and should only be called \"controlled\".\n =||= I suspect with use case 1 and 2 you mean the different cases as outlined above by @oscargus. While I see that these two different use cases exist in practice, I wouldn't separate them that clearly in the code. \nIn my opinion all the author related stuff should be handled by the AuthorList class (or as you proposed PersonList). This means:\ninput -> parse by AuthorList -> output to sensible format\n\nThe first step should be the same for both use cases and only the second step might be different for \"good\" vs \"bad\" data. \n\nBut as I said above, I have not a very deep understanding of this Author-formatting business. \n =||= The main reason to have two cases is that one of them is based on guessing\nand basically cannot be systematically reversed.\n =||= Since the code of the two use cases fundamentally differs and the guessing could go wrong, I would vote for keeping it separated. I understand, however, the user perspective to have only one formatter.\n\nIn the current state, I don't have resources to work on improving the fix algorithm. Would it be OK to keep them separated for now and to aim for an integration later?\n =||= Small note: the recently released version 3.3 of biblatex changed a few things related to naming.

Table is always using the full width of the JabRef window\n2. Table is using fixed widths for each column - if the space is not enough there is a horizontal scrollbar - if there is too much space parts are simply empty.\n\nIt is possible to switch between those two behaviors by changing the preferences in the tab \"Entry Table\" -> \"Fit table horizontally on screen\".\n\nWhat is the problem with the current solution?\nI think \"fit horizontally\" is a sensible default, as free/empty space after all table columns does not make any sense - and normally a horizontal scrollbar is not wished by the users, too. \nHowever, the current implementation has some drawbacks: \nIf a single column is resized all other columns are resized, too (to fill the gap, or to create the needed space) - this makes it rather hard to adjust the column width to your preferred style (e.g., year should be just big enough to show all 4 digit year numbers).\nAnd: After resizing the JabRef window all adjustments are just gone...\n\nIt is already possible to define column width in the preferences (-> \"Entry table columns\") - but these column widths are only used, if \"fit table horizontally\" is not active. \n\nIn my opinion the best solution would be:\n- ability to define a minimal width for each column\n- ability to define that a column should not be scaled\n- automatic sizing of the table: \n  - Each column should have at least its minimal size - if the space is not sufficient, a horizontal scrollbar should be used.\n  - Columns with fixed size should use those fixed sizes\n  - If there is additional space left the remaining columns could be broadend to use this space. \n\nE.g., all special columns, the # column, entrytype and year have a fixed width - title, author/editor and journal are dynamic and use the remaing space in the table...\n\n**Any remarks to this concept? Do you propose another solution?**\n\nProblem is: I'm not quite sure whether Swing does actually support this behavior out of the box as it is a mixture between fixed widths and automatic scaling to avoid horizontal scrollbars...

First of all, there many variables that influence the column width (padding, table grid on/off, vertical scrollbar, ...). Secondly, we have to decide a few things: a) how do you handle the new space when a column is resized b) how to distribute the remaining space after the fixed-size columns (equally, by preferred width, by ?).

To me, the dialog looks like this:\n![jabref-about-dialog](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1515701/14021180/b6309638-f1da-11e5-8894-3a89e14f8be4.png)\nLooks like variables are not read correctly?\n =||= I have the same thing with the old about dialog, too when I run it from eclipse directly.\n =||= I think you need to configure eclipse/IntelliJ to run/build via gradle. \n =||= Yes, if I build the release jar and start it from the console, the about dialog looks correct on master. However, if I build the release for this branch it looks like this:\n![jabref-about-dialog](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1515701/14026317/9a8b9b86-f1f2-11e5-9131-f75c3e0884d6.png)\nAlso nothing happens if I click on the empty menu item. What else am I doing wrong?\n =||= @lenhard  Yes, I experience the same after I applied the changes.  I'll take a look\nEdit// I found the problem, but I don't understand it :confused:  \n@boceckts Please have a look.\n\nIn the file AboutAction.java, when I add a`System.out.println()` before it works correclty.\nIf I uncomment it again, I experience the same behaviour as mentioned above.\n\n``` java\n @Override\n    public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {\n        System.out.println(\"Action performed\");\n        Platform.runLater(() -> dialog.show());\n    }\n```\n =||= This is a really strange behaviour as it works fine for me. However I have seen a fellow student having the same issue only that it was not reproduceable and appeared sometimes on the first execution after he pulled my changes. Further executions always worked for him though. Since there was no error message in the console it might be an issue on how/where you start it? I will further investigate and try to reproduce the effect on different operating systems. Which os and java version did you use?\n =||= Your comments make this sound very much like a threading issue. Platform.runLater also executes on the FX thread, right? @Siedlerchr perhaps adding the sysout leads to a synchronization that doesn'the necessarily happen otherwise. \n =||= I tried a bit around and for me adding this line in AboutDialog:\n`fxmlLoader.setController(new AboutDialogController())`\nfixes the problem.\nI can run it from Eclipse and it shows the code directly.\nAfter doing a gradlew release I can run it with java -jar and it works, too.  (Win 7, x64 java 8u72\nThe same with gradlew run\n =||= @Siedlerchr this line should be called implicitly since the fx:controller attribute is set in the AboutDialogLayout.fxml file. This happens on my windows 7, x64 and java 8u73 after I pulled changes from the remote. Strangely if I don't change any files at all and re-run the execution it works fine and stays that way. @Siedlerchr Can you remove the line and check if execution works as normal now?\n =||= > Strangely if I don't change any files at all and re-run the execution it works fine and stays that way. \n> @Siedlerchr Can you remove the line and check if execution works as normal now?\n\nYes, this is really odd behavior. I now experience the same.\nSeems like it is only the first run which is problematic. All further runs seem to be ok\n =||= After investing quite some time to set up virtual machines I tried a lot to reproduce this odd behaviour on different os' and came to the following conclusion. \n\n**How I tested:**\n1. I updated my Java Version to 1.8.0_77 (execpt for openjdk 1.8.0_66  and openjfx 8u60 which were the newest versions I could find)\n2. I cloned my repository (if not already available)\n3. If I had a local working branch named \"AboutDialogFX\" I first deleted this one.\n4. Executed 'git checkout origin/AboutDialogFX'\n5. Executed './gradlew run'\n6. Check for menu item and open the about dialog if applicable\n7. Close Application and repeat step 5-7, four times (and more)\n\n**Results:**\n\nWindows 7, 64bit, java8u77\n1. run: About Jabref menu item available and dialog opens normally\n2. run: **Menu item not available and dialog won't open, no exception**\n3. run: About Jabref menu item available and dialog opens normally\n4. run: About Jabref menu item available and dialog opens normally\n**After trying a trying more runs, the 9th run showed the same behaviour as the 2nd one**\n\nMacOsX 10.11.1, java8u77\n1. run: About Jabref menu item available and dialog opens normally\n2. run: About Jabref menu item available and dialog opens normally\n3. run: About Jabref menu item available and dialog opens normally\n4. run: About Jabref menu item available and dialog opens normally\n_After trying a trying more runs, the same behaviour occured_\n\nUbuntu 14.04, 64bit, oracle java8u77\n1. run: About Jabref menu item available and dialog opens normally\n2. run: About Jabref menu item available and dialog opens normally\n3. run: **Menu item not available and dialog won't open, no exception**\n4. run: About Jabref menu item available and dialog opens normally\n**After trying a trying more runs, the 6th, 7th and 8th run showed the same behaviour as the 3rd one**\n\nUbuntu 14.10, 64bit, oracle java8u77\n1. run: About Jabref menu item available and dialog opens normally\n2. run: About Jabref menu item available and dialog opens **but does not show elements and doesn't respond**\n3. run: About Jabref menu item available and dialog opens normally\n4. run: About Jabref menu item available and dialog opens normally\n**After trying a trying more runs, the 6th run showed the same behaviour as the 2nd one**\n\nUbuntu 14.10, 64bit, openjdk8u66 openjfx8u60\n1. run: About Jabref menu item available and dialog opens normally, **however build does not finish when closing JabRef, console stays at '> Building 85% > :run'**\n2. run: About Jabref menu item available and dilalog opens normally, **however build does not finish when closing JabRef, console stays at '> Building 85% > :run'**\n3. run: About Jabref menu item available and dialog opens normally, **however build does not finish when closing JabRef, console stays at '> Building 85% > :run'**\n4. run: About Jabref menu item available and dialog opens normally, **however build does not finish when closing JabRef, console stays at '> Building 85% > :run'**\n_After trying a trying more runs, the same behaviour occured_\n\n**My Conculsion**\n\nFrom my perspective this strange behaviour looks like something in java is not always 'initialized' when the application launches. As there is no exception even when the menu item is not shown I doubt the fault is in my commits. It also seems like the behaviour appears at random and cross platform on (almost) all oracle jdks (at least with version 8u77). I don't really know how to proceed as there is clearly something wrong but I have no idea how to fix this...\n =||= I have no idea, but good work in trying out the different configurations! :+1: \n =||= I tried it with the [modified version](https://github.com/boceckts/jabref/pull/1) and it seems to be fine there. I think the issue is the method initComponentsInFXThread. As far as I can see there is no need to init the about action in the FXThread. So just add the menu entry as usual and then init the FX dialog in AboutAction.actionPerformed. Maybe this is worth a shot. \nMoreover, when you write `no exception`, did you also had a look at the help > error console? I had it quite a few times that no exception dialog was shown but an error message was logged there.\n =||= @tobiasdiez I will have a look at the modified version soon. Since I started the build from the console I looked at the os specific terminal/console and yes there is about 16xtimes this sentence in the console \"OpenGL Warning: crPixelCopy3D:  simply crMemcpy'ing from srcPtr to dstPtr\" on windows and ubuntu. But regardless if the about JabRef menu item is there or not. On ubuntu there is an additionally \"libGL error: core dri or dri2 extension not found\" and \"libGL error: failed to load driver: vboxvideo\" in the console. With \"no exception\" I meant something like a java Exception with a stacktrace pointing to a faulty line of code.\n =||= @boceckts Thanks for the details. What I meant is the JabRef internal error console available under the help menu. While trying out some JavaFX stuff I had the feeling that some of the error messages just got lost (for example, change the fxml file to something invalid...then the about menu item does not show up but there is no exception), but some of them showed up in the internal error console. \n =||= @tobiasdiez Thanks for the tip! I thought everything that gets written to the internal JabRef Error Console also gets printed to the console I started it from? But I had a look at it and still didn't find any exceptions.\nThis new version creates a new dialog each time the user clicks on the About JabRef menu item. In the previous commit i only wanted to create the dialog once and store it in an object to speed up things when opening the dialog multiple times. This worked just fine for mac and windows but strangely enough the dialog looked different for every second time I opened it on ubuntu 14.04/15.10 with the latest oracle jdk. I didn't test this commit as excessive as the first one but it seems like the \"hidden menu item\" bug doesn't appear anymore and the window looks the same even when opening it multiple times on all my test systems.\nThe big disadvantage I see is that each time I want to open the dialog it takes time to create it first. It may not matter for such a small dialog but needs to be considered when porting bigger dialogs such as the preferences one in the same way.\n =||= We recently discussed in the devcall how to further proceed with this PR. \nPlease implement the following points:\n- Use the [afterburner.fx library](https://github.com/AdamBien/afterburner.fx) to hard-coding of fxml or css file names. See https://github.com/boceckts/jabref/pull/1 (no need to use the dependency injection stuff)\n- Add static strings to the fxml file, so for example `text=\"%Close\"`. The preceding percentage sign makes sure that the text is automatically translated.\n- As you mentioned above, a central css file should be created to define the general look (e.g. background color)\n- The design of the dialog can be improved a bit. You can take the about dialog of intelliJ or firefox (or whatever you like) as a source of inspiration. There is no need to stick to the old JabRef layout.\n\nThere were a few more remarks, which I want to make directly against the code. But right now it seems like there are merge problems.\n\n## \n\nRemarks for the next dialogs implemented in JavaFX:\n- You might try out the MVVM pattern as sketched in https://github.com/boceckts/jabref/pull/1. We want to evaluate which pattern works better with JavaFX.\n- A quick mockup of how you plan to design the dialog would be nice before you actually implement it. Most dialogs are ~~horrible~~ hard to use and should be improved.\n =||= @tobiasdiez I updated my branch against JabRef/master but the pull request is on JabRef/javafx which hasn't been updated. I think updating the JabRef/javafx branch would resolve the commit chaos.\n\nAs for the design I thought about using an accordion element to display the different section titles e.g. authors, developers and the user can expand whatever he wants to see. \n =||= I updated the javafx branch to the same commit you are based. So once you update the PR hopefully the large amount of false changes disappears. \n\nI made some small comments to the code (by default, these are only visible in a collapsed state here on github for some reason). In general, the code really looks good! :+1: I especially like the FXAlert class.\n\nSo codewise this PR can be merged in from my point of view. Regarding the design, I liked the previous version a bit more. @JabRef/developers any ideas how the dialog should look like? Our dialog shows more infos than in other programs (like IntelliJ) so it hard to copy their design...\n =||= I just updated the javafx branch to the latest HEAD (in master).\n =||= The comments are addressed now @tobiasdiez .\nI have to note two things though, before someone else finds them.. :)\nFor me the localization of strings specified in the fxml file does not work for strings with an underscore (_). If I specified \"%Copy_Version\" in the fxml file it would give me a button text saying \"Copy_Version\" instead of \"Copy Version\". That's why I implemented the workaround with setting the button text to a string property of the controller (\"${controller.copyButtonText}\") and translating it there.\nSecond thing to note is that when using the afterburnerfx library the resource files (.css, .fxml) need to be in the same directroy as the View (e.g. AboutDialogView) in the resource folder. I first wanted to put them in the resources in a package gui.help instead of net.sf.jabref.gui.help but it could not be found and so far I haven't seen a possibility to set the path of the fxml and css files in the FXMLView class or its subclass.\n =||= LGTM :+1:\nRegarding the underscore in the localization string: this is strange.\nAs far as I can see, the FXML loader simply calls `resources.getString(aValue);` with the provided key, see http://hg.openjdk.java.net/openjfx/8/master/rt/file/tip/modules/fxml/src/main/java/javafx/fxml/FXMLLoader.java. If the key is not found, then an exception should be thrown. Probably, the resource is found, but not fixed (so `Copy_Version` is returned). Does it work if you change the value to `Copy\\ version` in the language file?\n\nDid you tried out if `%Copy version` (with space) or with escaped space `%Copy\\ version` in the fxml file works? Probably not...\n =||= I tried writing \"%Copy_Version\", \"%Copy Version\" and \"%Copy\\ Version\", the first gave me \"Copy_Version\" and the last two gave me an exception with the message \"Resource \"Copy Version\" not found.\" and \"Resource \"Copy\\ Version\" not found.\". The errors persited when changing the language file to a key Copy\\ Version.\n =||= Ok, thanks for testing. One last shot: does `Copy_Version = Copy\\ Version` (or `Copy_Version = justToTest`) in the resource file and `%Copy_Version` work?\n =||= The first one gives the desired result. the second one works as well.\n =||= Should I change it and use \"Copy_Version=Copy\\ Version\" in the Localization file?\nAlso this is an issue when translating single words to multiple words in a different languages. For example I translated \"Contribution=Beitrag_leisten\" and used text=\"%Contribution\" in the fxml file. Setting the language to german gives a tabbed pane named \"Beitrag_leisten\" instead of \"Beitrag leisten\". So maybe it is best to always use the controller injected methode for translating strings?\n =||= Probably the cleanest version would be to derive a new class from ResourceBundle which incorporates the same logic as the translate method, i.e. something along the lines\n\n``` java\npublic Object handleGetObject(String key) {\n  String propertiesKey = new LocalizationKey(key).getPropertiesKeyUnescaped();\n  translation = resBundle.getString(propertiesKey);\n  return new LocalizationKey(translation).getTranslationValue();\n}\n```\n\nWe will discuss this matter in the next devcall. But if you are motivated, then you are of course allowed to implement such a solution. Or you channel your motivation to the next dialog and create a [mockup](https://jabref.mybalsamiq.com/projects/ui/grid), as you prefer. \n =||= Well I wanted to port the customize key bindings dialog but I wouldn't change its layout since in my opinion it's quite practical.\n =||= We should sit together and think about a good design. I would like to have tabs instead of these strange pull down menus. Reason: responsiveness of the UI. If I click something, I want to read the things instantly. Proposal: Fix the minor issues here, then merge and then think about a good design of the dialog.\n\nI liked the JabRef 3.2 About dialog more - maybe we can put each heading into a tab and render the first two paragraphs above that.\n\n![grabbed_20160425-090444](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1366654/14776156/cd671c7a-0ac4-11e6-9f7c-8ce02bb76a6f.png)\n![grabbed_20160425-090519](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1366654/14776162/dc647e02-0ac4-11e6-8d5c-6edd3fc11f7b.png)\n =||= For reference: The current state of the dialog:\n\n![grabbed_20160425-090724](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1366654/14776203/2ac91b48-0ac5-11e6-95f9-807c472de3bb.png)\n =||= ## [Current coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/JabRef/jabref/pull/968?src=pr) is **27.32%**\n\n> Merging [#968](https://codecov.io/gh/JabRef/jabref/pull/968?src=pr) into [javafx](https://codecov.io/gh/JabRef/jabref/branch/javafx?src=pr) will decrease coverage by **-0.00%**\n\n``` diff\n@@           javafx    #968   diff @@\n=====================================\n  Files         696     699     +3   \n  Lines       46446   46557   +111   \n  Methods         0       0          \n  Branches     7703    7705     +2   \n=====================================\n+ Hits        12719   12721     +2   \n- Misses      32628   32738   +110   \n+ Partials     1099    1098     -1   \n```\n1. 2 files (not in diff) in `.../net/sf/jabref/logic` were modified.

At the moment it is handled by https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/master/src/main/java/net/sf/jabref/gui/InternalBibtexFields.java and especially the class BibtexSingleField in that file.\n\nCurrently the following properties are defined:\n- `final String name;` - the name of the field\n-  `int flag` - a combination of \n\n``` java\n        private static final int STANDARD = 0x01; // it is a standard bibtex-field\n        private static final int PRIVATE = 0x02; // internal use, e.g. owner, timestamp\n        private static final int DISPLAYABLE = 0x04; // These fields cannot be shown inside the source editor panel\n        private static final int WRITEABLE = 0x08; // These fields will not be saved to the .bib file.\n```\n- `int length` - field length in characters(?)\n- `double weight` - weight factor used for relative row size in the entry editor columns(?)\n- `int editorType` - may be one of\n\n``` java\n    // constants for editor types:\n    public static final int STANDARD_EDITOR = 1;\n    public static final int FILE_LIST_EDITOR = 2;\n```\n- `String extras;` - Determines any extra component in the entry editor, currently one of:\n\n``` java\n    public static final String EXTRA_YES_NO = \"yesNo\"; // Blank/Yes/No Combo-box\n    public static final String EXTRA_URL = \"url\"; // Drop target for URL\n    public static final String EXTRA_DATEPICKER = \"datepicker\"; // Calendar button and double-click in field to set current date\n    public static final String EXTRA_JOURNAL_NAMES = \"journalNames\"; // Journal abbreviation button\n    public static final String EXTRA_EXTERNAL = \"external\"; // Open external viewer on double-click\n    public static final String EXTRA_BROWSE = \"browse\"; // Browse button, file dialog\n    public static final String EXTRA_SET_OWNER = \"setOwner\"; // Button to set owner to current used\n    public static final String EXTRA_MONTH = \"month\"; // Button to show the months and set abbreviation\n```\n- `boolean numeric;` - true if the field is expected to be numeric and in that way one can sort based on that\n\nMy idea is to extend this. Currently, there are quite a lot of different fields, especially in Biblatex that has the \"same\" properties. For example, there are about ten or so different fields with names defined and it would be much better if one could check `field.isNameField()` instead of comparing against all the possible field names (now, mainly author and editor is checked). This would be useful for e.g. the integrity checks. Similarly, it would make sense if the field knew how it should be sorted (e.g. the date field in biblatex could use a dedicated comparator). Also, some fields can only take on specific values, either from a list (like month or languague) or being a number, like year. From a layout perspective, it is discussed in #967 that different fields should have minimum/maximum sizes and that some benefit from resizing, some not. Add to that alignment and the size required in the entry editor.\n\nThe purpose of this issue is to try to come up with a good redesign of BibtexSingleField. It appears to me as there are a few larger problems here:\n1. Which properties should be included? \n2. How is this mapped in practice from fieldname to property? Probably one should refactor and move this to logic as some methods in logic right now tests for fieldname.\n3. How should they be set (and saved) in practice? Like today, but extended? Would somehow be nicer if each type (or class of types) has the default knowledge.\n4. What about defining custom fields?\n5. Is this saved per database or in the preferences?\n\nTo this end, I'd suggest the following fields:\n- `String name`\n-  `int flag` - as before\n- `int type` - Combination of the following constants (numerical value tbd, probably more are needed, the Biblatex manual decribes this pretty well)\n  - `namelist` - for author names - gives the field editor button and triggers \"correct\" integrity checkers\n  - `keyword` - field editor, can be set for other fields as well (which some people appears to be using)\n  - `journal` - journal list/abbreviation\n  - `title` - integrity check\n  - `date` - date picker, special sorter, integrity check\n  - `month` - month list, integrity check (number in Biblatex)\n  - `integer` - numerical sorting, only numerical value(?) (used for e.g. year, maybe number and volume, some IEEE fields)\n  - `pagerange` - integrity checker\n  - `file` - file-field parsing\n  - `yesno` - IEEE yes/no\n  - `language` - select among languages (is a list)\n  - `pagination` - list of pagination alternatives\n  - `editortype` - list of editor type alternatives\n  - `texcode` - probably warn if one runs latex to unicode conversion on this field...\n  - `uri` - droptarget for URL, possibility to open URL \n  - `doi` - special handling and checking\n  - `owner` - set owner on double-click\n  - `crossref` - must be a bibtexkey\n  - `gender` - list of alternatives\n  - `options` - key=value pairs\n  - `related` - bibtexkeys (not what is sometimes discussed as \"referenced by\" etc)\n  - `relatedtype` - list of options (see Biblatex documentation)\n\nEntry editor related\n- `double weight` - as before\n\nMain table related\n- `boolean resizable`\n- `int minimalSize`\n- `int maximalSize`\n- `LayoutFormatter layoutFormatter` - should a layoutformatter be used for the field and in that case which(?)\n- `boolean resolve` - should the field be resolved for strings(?)\n- `Comparator comparator` ? or handle by type?\n- `int alignment` - one of left, right, center (are there use cases for center? Numbers should probably be right-aligned anyway)", "First of all I suggest to use Enums with EnumSets instead of the int-Flags:\nSee http://eddmann.com/posts/using-bit-flags-and-enumsets-in-java/\n\nFrom my perspective I would be in favor of separating gui and logic, and not store the mainTable sizes in the internal fields.\n =||= We want to get rid of these flags anyway.

In my opinion supporting BibLatex is more important then IEEE (no pun intended against IEEE users :smiley: ). \n\nShowing a dialog asking for confirmation is also disturbing in most cases.

Would that make more sense?\n =||= Another \"solution\" might be to add a checkbook to the far right that enables the diff view (and possibly a preference if it should be on or off by default).\n =||= Nice idea.\n\nI would opt for a symmetric version. I.e. highlight all diffs on both sides similar to how kdiff3 handles this.

Seems a bit overpowered for such an easy merge task from my point of view. In the end it's just a Bibtex entry and not a huge source code diff. \n =||= @tobiasdiez I was thinking about that. However, in most cases the left entry is the original (well, not in the plain merge entries, but when merging DOI information and when called from the ImportInspectionDialog) and this will make it even more cluttered (or how would it look, I cannot really generalize the idea from your screen shot, partly because line differences are not really relevant here).\n\nThe current formatting is quite similar to [latexdiff](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/latexdiff) so frequent users of that might appreciate it.\n\n@stefan-kolb I think that when you get two almost identical abstracts and need to pick one, you will appreciate it. :-) But I agree that for large differences it is of less use and also that in some cases (e.g. differently formatted names), it is probably more of a problem.\n\nBtw, if you look carefully at the screen shot you can see that it is not fully working. That should be fixed now.\n =||= Its hard to explain in words and I have to admit the screenshot is also not too helpful. Let me try again:\nThe idea was to highlight additions.

Changes (i.e. `A` vs `a`) could be highlighted using a different color.\nIn this way you have a more symmetric view and don't run into the problems mentioned by @stefan-kolb.\n =||= @tobiasdiez Thanks for the explanation, I believe I got it now. I think that it can be done like that as well. However, I believe that both methods are good, so in that case I will support both (I assume that there could be people that want to turn it off completely as well...).\n =||= OK, I have added a diff mode based on what I understood from @tobiasdiez. The code structure is at least slightly better now, but the fundamental code is indeed quite ugly.\n\nWhat should one call the three different diff modes? \"Plain text\" seems quite obvious, but then? \"Latexdiff style\" is a possible alternative for the first example, but what about the one below?\n\nInput on formatting is also welcome.

I propose to remove the symmetric ones, and maybe use either latex word or character diff. For me, the word diff seems to be more helpful. \n =||= I propose plain text and latex diff character. I see a use for larger text passages like abstract or review where I think diff style character is best. In general I wouldnt include such hacker functionality at all since I think my eyes can see the differences between two strings best in plain text except for the two exceptions mentioned. I would be OK with such a compromise. Let's see what the majority decides.\n =||= Thanks @oscargus for this feature. Very useful!\n\nTo me, the \"LaTeXdiff style - character\" is the most useful: I can quickly grasp the differences. However for a small difference in a long text (such as an abstract), the \"LaTeXdiff style - single word\" may better show it.\n\nI believe Plain text is not useful. My rational is that the software should help me see the differences: Why should I have a mode that make me spend time on searching for differences?\nJust my opinion.\n\nAlso (please, let me know if I should open a new issue):\n- mouse scrolling is very very slow for the top part of the window (while it works as expected on the lower part --- both right and left sides).\n- I never got the abstract from the DOI...  :cry:\n- It would be convenient if pressing \"ESC\" could close this window (like for other windows).\n =||= Not sure what the consensus is here, as I understand it these are the standpoints:\n\n| Person | Preference |\n| --- | --- |\n| @stefan-kolb | Plain text (maybe latexdiff, character) |\n| @simonharrer | Plain text, latexdiff, word (maybe character) |\n| @tobiasdiez | symmetric |\n| @mlep | latexdiff, character (maybe word) |\n\nRemaining @JabRef/developers: do you want to have a say?\n\nI've updated with a new version with the latexdiff version in both modes, so:\n- Plain text\n- Show diff - word\n- Show diff - character\n\nHaven't removed the symmetric code yet though.\n\n@mlep : will try to add ESC-closing! The mouse scrolling I'm not really sure how to fix (and do not notice).\n =||= To me, the current state looks good enough(tm). I would recommend making the Diff - Latex - Chars the default. \n =||= OK! I went for that.\n =||= About  ESC-closing and mouse scrolling, shall I open 2 new issues (for later triage)?\n =||= @mlep, it might be the safest...\n =||= I really like the symmetric version you posted in https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/1022#issuecomment-200574905. \n =||= I do not have any strong opinions. I like the idea to be able to see the differences (obviously) and I do not really see it as a problem if there are quite a few variants. Most people would try them out and find one or two useful and leave it there. The overhead in terms of preferences is the same as well.\n\nIt is more or less just to revert the last commit, add translations for the symmetric case (and come up with good names, which seems to be the most tricky part if we have two variants), and change the default (as that was part of the commit).\n =||= FYI: I preferred the \"Show diff\" because the \"Symmetric\" requires me to look at both sides of the window to find the differences.

Since it is based on DOI lookup and a rather generic reg exp, the DOI resolution page can be changed and it should still succeed. Then, of course, it is probably more likely that the intermediate frame page and the stamp mechanism is changed than the API...\n =||= I think it is a cool addition :smile: ! However, I'm still not really happy with the regex approach, let's see what the others think!\n =||= LGTM\n =||= I'm not so happy with the addition of the download via the URL. Whereas it is convenient, I'd like to keep the Fetchers based on \"immutable\" values. Something like DOI or Eprint should normally stay the same. A URL is not a goog identifier in my opinion. This suggestion is more like a general discussion for keeping the implementations of the fetchers focused and not cluttering them with a lot of download options (by DOI, Eprint, URL, Title,...). WDYT?\n =||= What is great in your approach is that you check for a IEEE DOI and skip if it is not issued by the vendor. This could be nice for the other fetchers too as we save HTTP request etc. However, I'm not sure if we can savely find out all DOIs that can be issued by a vendor.\n =||= The main reason for adding URL support is that IEEE also have some papers\nwithout IEEE DOI. That was the main reason for adding the URL-part. Adding\nmore DOI doesn't work as those publishers sends elsewhere (or to an\nintermediate page where one can select provider).\n\nIt is primarily only useful for older bib-files as the current IEEE search\ndoesn't add it. Not sure what e.g. Google provides. However, with better\nmeta data search it can be quite useful. At the moment it was more a\nconvenience thing to be able to populate my old bib-files with PDFs.\n =||= Is anything missing here or can this be merged?\n =||= Apart from the disagreement on using the URL or not it can be merged.\n =||= The thing is that even using the DOI one will currently need to rely on a given URL as the DOI points to a HTML page with a frame in which the PDF is loaded. If they would change that, one would also need to change the code.\n\nThe benefit, as stated above, is that papers with non-IEEE DOI on IEEE Xplore, can now be downloaded. This hold, e.g., for IET papers (Electronic Letters among others). Now, for this a better solution would indeed be to use the API as that provides the URL (as far as I can tell). Still, the HTML parsing must be done, but then one could get around the non-IEEE on IEEE Xplore issue.

Otherwise, it is kept as part of the parsed serialization of the entry. \n\nAs far as I know, JabRef has always overwritten such comments, but we might consider to change this functionalty (this has strong implications on parsing/writing)\n =||= Right now everything not contained in an entry (or @comment tag) is completely ignored by the parser. In particular, it is not saved anywhere and gets lost on rewrite. The problem with this floating-around text is that is not connected to any entry and thus the new position of it can not be determined on save. By the way, even user-defined @comment tags get lost. \n =||= I can understand that it is hard to keep everything for sure and I think that it is OK to some extent. If you use JabRef you do not need to do manual edits...\n =||= The fact that JabRef destroys content of the the `bib` file often prevents users to switch from plain text editing to JabRef. Therefore, I would propose to add a data structure to `BibEntry` which keeps the text lines above (somehow). Maybe, we offer a separate tab offering \"Comment\" showing the lines above the bib entry.\n =||= Adding a datastructure to `BibEntry` that keeps the lines above wouldn't actually be too difficult. The parser reads it like that already. But then, what happens to \n- all the comments below the last entry\n- comments that are mixed between meta data entries\n- comments between the first entry and the file header (special handling here)\n =||= From Devcall: We will try to keep all text in the file at the same position. I will have a look at how to implement this.\n =||= I had a first look at this. Unfortunately, this would be very very _very_ ugly. It would essentially require a rewrite of the parsing logic. As it turns out, arbitrary comments are _not_ stored at the moment even for the parsed serialization.\n\nA few things contribute to making this complicated:\n- We have a specific comment that we do not want to keep: The encoding file header at the begin of a file. This is really a major reason for complication and the origin of a lot of specialist code, since we cannot just plainly keep all text, but need to decide somehow. How should the parser detect the structure of the header, since that structure is not predefined (many possible different encodings)? Also what about 'random' file headers in the middle of the file? So far, the parser parses each entry regardless of its position in the file. This would no longer work if we want to remove only the first file header and keep everything else. Thus parsing would become more complex.\n- We have a 'gray' area that is rewritten every time: Meta data, strings, and the preamble. Here, no additonal text in between meta data entries is stored so far and storing it will require a major restructuring of our `MetaData` class. \n\nSince the serialization details are quite a nasty and un-fun part of work I hesitate to revisit (I have spent a good dozen hours only to get newline parsing correct for all of many different occasions) and it is not very motivating to throw large parts of what I wrote during the last three versions into the gutter again, I might not volunteer for implementing this.\n\nBtw.: If it helps, currently all text after the last entry is kept.\n =||= @stefan-kolb: For some external control, could you please try out your example from above with  #1471\n\nThis should preserve the comment in any case.

Important excerpts of the documentation: \"which accepts a single argument of the type of event desired; \" and \"The EventBus instance will determine the type of event and route it to all registered listeners.\". This enables to use a single bus with dedicated events such as `FieldContentChanged` etc.\n\nThus, please update this PR to\n- [x] <s>Introduce a Global EventBus into `net.sf.jabref.Globals`</s> Introduce an EventBus object being passed around. This enables better testing.\n- [x] Make `DatabaseChangeEvent` abstract and add subclasses according to `DatbaseChangeEvent`\n- [x] Rewrite the currently existing code to use that event bus instead of `net.sf.jabref.model.database.BibDatabase.addDatabaseChangeListener(DatabaseChangeListener)` and `net.sf.jabref.model.database.BibDatabase.removeDatabaseChangeListener(DatabaseChangeListener)`\n =||= Yes, it actually only demonstrates the base function. I think we should have a separate package for that. So I created a new one and created a interface, which should normalize the usage of Google guava. Now we are going to replace the existing listeners and as @koppor  already observed to prepare a global event bus.\n =||= Mhh...I'm not sure that a global event bus is the right way to go. It adds another global object, makes debugging harder, everyone gets informed about everything (it is hard to listen only to changes to a certain database) etc. But of course it also has its advantages. What is the opinion of the other @JabRef/developers here?\n =||= I think its OK to use one. Therefore we use different `Event` objects, which should prevent the chaos.\n =||= On the one hand, I don't like to pass around the EventBus object everywhere. It is a global thing and used everywhere. Maybe we should place it in `net.sf.jabref.gui.GUIGlobals`.\n\nOn the other hand, I agree that a global object makes testing difficult.\n\nLet's hear about design ideas by the others. This, however, doesn't stop @obraliar replacing the old event system. The \"location\" of the EventBus object can be changed later on.\n =||= @obraliar Please do not take further action until @JabRef/developers decided which way to go.\n =||= No opinions? If not, we would begin to discuss the details internally within the stupro group.\n =||= Sorry, but (in contrast to other developers) I do not see why we need an event system. Everything we need should be doable with the plain old observer pattern and the benefit of an event bus is not clear to me. \n\nThis will be discussed in a devcall, which may or may not take place soon.\n =||= Now all entry events only base upon Google's Guava Bus System.\nThe integrated event system (listener registration, event posts & receivements, etc.) works.\n\nHere are some new findings:\n- We have to use one EventBus for each BibDatabase, cause there may be more than one opened. A main event such as `AddEntryEvent` should not affect all opened databases.\n- For all other events that do not affect BibDatabase we could introduce one general EventBus. This part of introduction is very easy, but I see no need for that yet.\n =||= ## [Current coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/JabRef/jabref/pull/1028?src=pr) is **27.56%**\n\n> Merging [#1028](https://codecov.io/gh/JabRef/jabref/pull/1028?src=pr) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/JabRef/jabref/branch/master?src=pr) will increase coverage by **+<.01%**\n\n``` diff\n@@             master      #1028   diff @@\n==========================================\n  Files           695        699     +4   \n  Lines         46294      46290     -4   \n  Methods           0          0          \n  Messages          0          0          \n  Branches       7650       7641     -9   \n==========================================\n- Hits          12759      12758     -1   \n+ Misses        32435      32433     -2   \n+ Partials       1100       1099     -1   \n```\n1. 2 files (not in diff) in `...va/net/sf/jabref/gui` were modified.

Maybe one should tuck the user preferences away as they are more rarely changed. I mean, you would like to have live search by default but be able to disable it if required. I can also imagine that some people want to get rid of autocompletion sometimes (with that said I haven't checked if one can configure it). An \"advanced settings\" button with pop-up menu?\n =||= I am somewhat unsure where we should be heading here. I think we should try to reduce the number of preferences the user can input as JabRef has so many options, it can make it very hard to use. \n\nIf we detect whether the database is small, medium or large in size, we could adjust the search automatically somehow? So it will not update immediatly if there are more than 1k entries? Or use a formula which computes the amount to wait between after a search. The issue is not the search itself (which is done in a separate thread) but the update of the UI after the search is done. \n\nSo basically, we could try to keep track of the search queries that are currently active through an atomic counter. And only update the UI when the counter has reached the value 1. \n =||= I agree on the preference thing in general. Still I think this is a rather straightforward setting and more importantly it doesn't really break anything if set the \"wrong\" way.\n\nSomehow, these automatic things will always turn out bad for some users and then they cannot change it. Apart from that I agree that it should be possible to come up with a scheme that is reasonable for most users. However, I'm not convinced it is worth the effort compared to the simple and fully waterproof switch. :-) \n\nTo me it can even be hidden in the preferences under a \"performance\" tab, where that and e.g. the new cell formatting can be switches off if required. All bells and whistles on, but can be disabled if performance is suffering.\n\nI have some thoughts related to preferences in general and will open an issue any day now.\n =||= Hm, ok.

Sure, that would be another way to solve it. Probably better from many perspectives.\n =||= I tried to implement a settings button and while it works I'm not really fond of the results. I've tried having both one menu item for filter/float (which is quite unclear) and having radio buttons for both options (which is better as one can have the full sentence), but I think that the additional icon is still the best. The whole search bar is quite compact now, so I do not think that the previous width problem is relevant. Also, if/when live search is removed (e.g. if non-overlapping search is implemented and works for 100000 entries...) it will be easier to just remove the button rather than remove the menu etc.\n =||= Do you think this is still necessary or this can be closed in favor having a faster overall search?\n =||= No, if the search speed has improved as much as it seems, I do not think this one is required.

That is, no class in logic should have a UI class in its import statements (that is ensured automatically by the architecture tests). \n\nTransitive dependencies that come via external jars are a gray area to some degree (for reasons of practicality). If you have a jar that bundles UI and logic code, it is fine to use it in our logic package as long as you do not access the UI classes in the jar. Otherwise, better keep these dependencies in the gui package. \n\nYou have mixed types of dependencies. `com.sun.star.beans` and `com.sun.star.container` can be referenced in logic without problems. `com.sun.star.uno` should also be fine. `com.sun.star.text` has GUI and non-GUI content, so it depends on the usage, and `com.sun.star.frame` should definitly not be referenced from logic. Unless you can separate these dependencies, rather keep the referencing classes in GUI.\n =||= Thanks for clarifying. I guess it is really OOBibBase and OOUtil that require a bit of thinking. OOUtil is primarily a set of static methods, one which contains swing stuff, so that can easily be moved to a separate class (or just into a calling class). Regarding the sun stuff it is indeed not obvious where to draw the line, but I'll make an attempt based on your discussion.\n\nExceptions will go based on where they are thrown unless that somehow breaks the logic vs gui rule (although I do not think that will/can happen).\n =||= `OpenOfficeFileSearch` and `AutoDetectPath` can be improved for Linux and once that is done, the idea is to make a similar flow as for Windows/OSX. That is: get list of candidate directories, search through them, if nothing found open a file dialog, if more than one found pick from list, finalize. Similar to JabRefDesktop one can have an interface and then a class for each OS. I'm a bit confused regarding Linux at the moment though, so I need much more input there. Maybe it is better to merge after review and sort out the Linux search and the structure later.\n =||= I had a look at your distribution of oo classes to the gui/logic packages and it seems fine!

That really depends on the code inside the try-catch-block.\n =||= One of the sun methods throw Exception. Apart from the Throwable I believe\nthat most of the code catches as detailed exceptions as possible  (as I\nspent some time earlier tuning that). If I remember correctly quite a bit\nof the Exception/Throwable catching in JabRef is of a rather generic type:\nrun some methods which doesn't explicitly throw something and surround them\nwith a try block just in case so that nothing breaks if an exception is\nthrown (to avoid halting the application I assume).

As an example consider the OpenOfficePreferences in #1047. When designing that I faced a number of problems which, well, were not solved as in #658. Let me outline the issues, how #658 and #1047 differs and how it might be solved.\n\nFirst, the purpose, I assume, is to provide an intermediate \"layer\" which handles preferences for a specific subset of the code. In #1047 it was all the preferences related to the OO connection. This makes sense since one can have nicely named methods and not have to access JabRefPreferences from a lot of different classes.\n\n\"logic and gui should not know JabRefPreferences\":\nWhere should the Preferences class be stored? Should there be another main branch, preferences, where OpenOfficePreferences are in preferences.openoffice? In this way one can enforce this through tests.\n\nWhat about splitting the current JabRefPreferences in three classes?\n1. Constants\n2. Default values\n3. The actual preference handling\nThis would simplify the maintenance a bit as it provides a better overview. JabRefPreferences is quite huge at the moment...\n\nWhere are the default preferences set and how are an object constructed?\nIn #658 the default values are added to JabRefPreferences and the class has a special method that takes a JabRefPreferences, and returns an instance with a special call in JabRefMain(?) as the constructor taken the preference values. In #1047 the constructor has JabRefPreferences as an argument and inserts default values on construction. The object in constructed in OpenOfficePanel, i.e., where it is in needed. Advantage in #658, easier to construct an object with a different set of preference values. (I'm actually a bit confused here as it wasn't obvious where the ProxyPreference object is actually used and I am too tired at the moment to check). Drawback with #1047: default preferences are only put in the preferences if OpenOfficePanel is instantiated. Advantage with #1047: the default values are \"near\" the preference class.\n\nI realize that this is a bit vague and I was hoping for a more stringent proposal, still I hope this can raise some discussion.\n\nFinally, would it make sense to add some method that removes selected preferences in the preference list? For example, all (except for maybe those in #1047 unless OpenOfficePanel is used) preferences with a null default value are probably obsolete and currently there are quite a few in at least my preference list.", "From my point of view I like the idea of splitting up the preferences a bit more. Instead of having one huge class. I would rather suggest to split up the Preferences by their Context, like it is done with all classes in packages, e.g. groups.\n\nI think the quote  \n\n> \"logic and gui should not know JabRefPreferences\":\n\nis about the direct access of the \"raw Preferences\". From what I think it it as meant as having an encapsulated layer over them which is for reading/updating preferences.\nThis layer, however, could then be accessed from the relevant classes that need em.\n =||= I agree on your interpretation. The question is just where that encapsulating layer should be placed? Most of the time, gui or logic is the natural place for it and I guess we do not really want to place it somewhere else just because it cannot be placed in the natural place.\n\n#859 is also relevant here.\n =||= At the moment we have the large plus that all preference keys are in a single place, which makes it very easy to add or remove or simply look up preferences. We should try to keep this, I think, because it has proven very useful many times during development and debugging. \n =||= - Place for default values and preference keys: As Simon explains, putting them all in the JabrefPreference class has its advantages. For the moment I would leave it that way and maybe reevaluate at a later point when more special preference classes are introduced. \n- Smaller preference classes encapsulating only a subset of similar preferences:\n  - Advantage: preferences are encapsulated by context\n  - There a mainly two ways to implement it. One way is to construct a proxy class which directly passes gets/sets through to `JabRefPreferences`, this is done in #1047. The other way is to use `loadFromPreferences` and `saveToPreference` methods as in #658. \n  - Advantages of proxy method: easy to implement, you can't forget to call `saveToPreference` so that the preference class is always in sync with JabRefPreferences.\n  - Advantages of having dedicated load/save methods: similar functionality can share the same preference class (for example `save` and `export` both use [`SavePreferences`](https://github.com/tobiasdiez/jabref/blob/c510134a57b2408adca7ef5bab9dd5503fe18bc7/src/main/java/net/sf/jabref/exporter/SavePreferences.java) but just have different loadFromPreference methods), some performance advantages since `JabRefPreferences.getValue` calls are rather expensive (so the mid-layer also serves as a cache). The main advantage is that testing is rather easy since you can completely ignore `JabRefPreferences` in your tests.\n  - In my opinion the advantages for dedicated load/save methods outperform the advantages of the proxy method. \n =||= Refs: #1579\n\nI think we have a consensus here, so I am closing this issue.

Just fix these and this PR is good to go.\n\nRegarding the import statements: It reads a little strange in this PR, as sometimes the statements are coalesced to a `*` and sometimes they are expanded (which is probably done by your IDE). However, we have no policy on that and I am not aware of a generally-accepted policy or performance-related benefits of either version. So it doesn't really matter from my point of view.\n =||= I think expanded is quite nice since it shows exactly which dependencies\nare added or removed. On the other hand they lead to quite a lot of \"unused\nimport\" warnings...\n =||= Thanks for your comments. I will address them later this evening. \nRegarding the import stuff, I think we should discuss it at  #1091.

See https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/938#issuecomment-195750242\n\nI cannot really judge now, because I have too little knowledge about this metadata thing in PDFs.\n =||= Ok, I will ask at the mailing list, but I get the feeling that [the developers of pdfbox switched to xmpbox _because_ they want strict parsing (i.e., rejecting non-standard extensions to xmp meta data](https://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/pdfbox-dev/201111.mbox/%3CCAMPCuthT8-xunvhRxgn86v23hRVFptRsNSGsj63FUtNgjXx-6Q@mail.gmail.com%3E).\n\nRegarding the relevance of the XMP feature, I really have no clue. I am not using it and do not know someone who does. If we do not need it, I would be very happy to throw it away. Is there any chance to find someone who knows and uses the feature and can shed some light on this? \n\nWe could disable it for v3.3 and wait until someone complains ;-)\n =||= And here is [the reply from the pdfbox mailing list](http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/pdfbox-users/201604.mbox/%3C570BD3AF.4040800%40t-online.de%3E):\n\n> This is a known problem, yes xmpbox does not support custom namespaces, \n> this was noticed too late (xmpbox is closely related to preflight, which \n> checks for PDF/A). It is on the list of things to discuss for 2.1\n> \n> \"- discussion/decision on XMP (shall we enhance XMPBox, restore Jempbox, \n> base on Adobe's XMP library, join forces with the FOP project \u2026)\"\n> \n> Until then, the workaround is to keep using jempbox.\n\nSo that pretty says it. For now, we cannot switch to xmpbox. I'd suggest to leave this PR open until there is a new release of xmpbox.\n =||= I just close the issue.

We cannot use the most recent version of pdfbox, so our options are:\n1. Completely re-write XMP-handling with a different library\n2.

It is outdated and will produce wrong results. I will do this right now. \n\nAs @oscargus said, we have tests which ensure that there are no obsolete or missing translation keys.\n\nAs @Siedlerchr seid, it is advised to run the script through gradle which ensures it is executed with the correct python version.\n\n```\n$ ./gradlew -b localization.gradle checkTranslationsSummary\n:checkTranslationsSummary\nsrc/main/resources/l10n\\JabRef_da.properties: 2 duplicates.\nsrc/main/resources/l10n\\JabRef_de.properties: 18 duplicates.\nsrc/main/resources/l10n\\JabRef_es.properties: 13 duplicates.\nsrc/main/resources/l10n\\JabRef_fa.properties: 1471 empty values.\nsrc/main/resources/l10n\\JabRef_fr.properties: ok\nsrc/main/resources/l10n\\JabRef_in.properties: 466 empty values.\nsrc/main/resources/l10n\\JabRef_it.properties: 231 empty values.\nsrc/main/resources/l10n\\JabRef_ja.properties: 149 empty values.\nsrc/main/resources/l10n\\JabRef_nl.properties: 792 empty values.\nsrc/main/resources/l10n\\JabRef_no.properties: 439 empty values.\nsrc/main/resources/l10n\\JabRef_pt_BR.properties: 22 duplicates.\nsrc/main/resources/l10n\\JabRef_ru.properties: 232 empty values.\nsrc/main/resources/l10n\\JabRef_sv.properties: 1 duplicates.\nsrc/main/resources/l10n\\JabRef_tr.properties: 78 empty values.\nsrc/main/resources/l10n\\JabRef_vi.properties: 584 empty values.\nsrc/main/resources/l10n\\JabRef_zh.properties: 545 duplicates.\nsrc/main/resources/l10n\\Menu_da.properties: 15 empty values.\nsrc/main/resources/l10n\\Menu_de.properties: ok\nsrc/main/resources/l10n\\Menu_es.properties: 1 empty values.\nsrc/main/resources/l10n\\Menu_fa.properties: 9 empty values.\nsrc/main/resources/l10n\\Menu_fr.properties: ok\nsrc/main/resources/l10n\\Menu_in.properties: 15 empty values.\nsrc/main/resources/l10n\\Menu_it.properties: 6 empty values.\nsrc/main/resources/l10n\\Menu_ja.properties: 4 empty values.\nsrc/main/resources/l10n\\Menu_nl.properties: 7 empty values.\nsrc/main/resources/l10n\\Menu_no.properties: 13 empty values.\nsrc/main/resources/l10n\\Menu_pt_BR.properties: 1 empty values.\nsrc/main/resources/l10n\\Menu_ru.properties: 6 empty values.\nsrc/main/resources/l10n\\Menu_sv.properties: 10 empty values.\nsrc/main/resources/l10n\\Menu_tr.properties: 3 empty values.\nsrc/main/resources/l10n\\Menu_vi.properties: 17 empty values.\nsrc/main/resources/l10n\\Menu_zh.properties: 6 empty values.\n\nBUILD SUCCESSFUL\n\nTotal time: 10.612 secs\n```\n\nThis shows that indeed we have duplicated values, for which we currently do not have any tests.

The reason ver2.1 identified the issue was in #1188 which merged with this one. It picked it up when I openned my .bib with old ver2.1  install by mistake, making me think something was no longer being checked. As I said, ver2.1 takes a lot longer to save (bad) but may save future grief when BibTeX wont typeset (Good, especially with LyX that 'hides' BibTeX faults).

My thought was \"WHY DOES AN OLDER VERSION PICK UP A BibTeX file ERROR\" while the current one does not! The older version isn't the problem, but it is IDENTIFIYING AN ERROR in the bib file accepted by the current version. I am not expert, but assume it may cause issues if you attempt to use the citation in a LaTeX paper. Lots of features are being removed, and I wondered if parsing the bib file for errors was one that should be retained. Maybe BibLateX handles non-BibTeX characters, so the check has been intentionally removed from the current versions. I hope someone who knows can identify if this is a problem in Ver 3.2 and JabRef_windows-x64_3_3dev--snapshot--2016-04-05--fast-search--e0380b7, or an intentional removal of code. \nI have reworded the steps in the original post to make it clearer (I hope).\nPS: I use LyX and have experienced major issues trying to Typeset if there are unicode characters in wrong place in the bibfile (by cutting and pasting directly from pdfs). LyX doesn't really tell you that is what is crashing things, so it takes ages to figure out it is something in the bib file, and even longer to find it. Typically it is a hidden character or a ligature. I was hoping these were picked up by the parsing that this issue refers to.\n =||= @ajbelle Please write me a personal email stating the features you miss. I personally fight for keeping all available issues and support everyone wanting to add an issue. The only thing I currently see being removed and really affecting someone is #496. - I know that there are other things being removed listed at https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md, but does anything affect you? Everything else seem to be issues being raised, because other issues (affecting other users). \n\nI made a minimal example:\n\n```\n\\documentclass{scrartcl}\n\n\\usepackage{filecontents}\n\\begin{filecontents}{\\jobname.bib}\n@misc{A01,\n  author = {Author, A.},\n  year = {2001},\n  title = {The &#8211 thing},\n}\n\\end{filecontents}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\n\\cite[1]{A01}\n\n\\bibliography{\\jobname}\n\\bibliographystyle{alpha}\n\n\\end{document}\n```\n\nThe error is \n\n```\n Misplaced alignment tab character &.\nl.5 \\newblock The &\n                   #8211 thing, 2001.\n\n```\n\nAnother example:\n\n```\n\\documentclass{scrartcl}\n\n\\usepackage{filecontents}\n\\begin{filecontents}{\\jobname.bib}\n@misc{A01,\n  author = {Author, A.},\n  year = {2001},\n  title = {The #8211 thing},\n}\n\\end{filecontents}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\n\\cite[1]{A01}\n\n\\bibliography{\\jobname}\n\\bibliographystyle{alpha}\n\n\\end{document}\n```\n\nResult:\n\n```\n! You can't use `macro parameter character #' in horizontal mode.\nl.5 \\newblock The #\n                   8211 thing, 2001.\n?\n```\n\nSo, you are right, JabRef allows saving files not being treatable by pdflatex.\n =||= Is this something for our integrity check? Should the integrity check being run \"on save\"?\n =||= THX @ koppor,  I hoped someone clever could see if what I noticed was a problem. I am never sure it isn't my old brain.\nI checked the CHANGELOG and could not see any issues I have not raised already. I think what the team is doing is great, and the speed increase is very noticeable with my large file. \n\n> 3.0 - 2015-11-29\n> Changed Added more characters to HTML/Unicode converter\n\nCould this change be related to the above issue, and possibly part of the solution given &#8211 is HML for \u2013\n\nIt would be good if the integrity check could make sure all 'unacceptable characters' are eliminated/converted rigourously.  \nA young programer next to me who uses JabRef imports everything though an ASCII text editor to prefilter, but that seems 'extreme' to me :-).\n =||= Correct HTML is `&#8211;`, you may also use `&ndash;` (or `&#x2013;`). This character has been around for quite some time, so it shouldn't be related to that ChangeLog entry. \n\nI'm surprised to see that JabRef now allows saving fields with a single # in it. This was definitely not allowed in earlier versions and I do not really know when this bug was introduced. \n\nIf you run the HTML to LaTeX converter it should be replaced with `--` (or, maybe not, since it is not proper HTML).\n\nAnother interesting aspect is that if you happen to have two of these, say `&#8211;&#8211;` it will be saved as `{\\&} # 8211;& #{8211;}`, so & is correctly escaped and 8211;& will be considered a string. As you may realize it is in the general case quite challenging for software to determine if you really would like that or not. (There are definitely use cases where one would like to have a similar structure for a field and JabRef use # in the fields to switch between strings and content, still an odd number of # doesn't make sense.)\n =||= Regarding %, I am not convinced that it should be automatically escaped. Apart from # which JabRef deals with explicitly, what is written in the field is LaTeX code. If you would have written &#8211 in a text editor you would have got exactly that behaviour. JabRef cannot check that you don't write `\\somesymbolthatdoesntexist`. Hence, I'm even skeptical to the escaping of & and I guess one can argue that it is only if you write two # that JabRef interfers. \n\nWith that said I still believe that JabRef should have functionality to automatically escape & etc, not just blindly on save. There may be cases where I actually want to have a & in my file. Say, if there is a tabular in the abstract. Note that the errors for @koppor are LaTeX errors, not bibtex errors, similar to whatever bad LaTeX code you might have written in your entries.\n\n(Btw, the file saved with the `&#8211;&#8211;` cannot be opened again...)\n =||= Regarding LaTex, all reserved chars should be escaped:\n`# $ % ^ & _ { } ~ \\`\n =||= To clarify, as a user, I do not input HTML codes and ligatures on purpose. They get pulled in with the various imports, often without my awareness. THX for the HTML to LaTeX converter hint @oscargus.\n\n Ver 2.1 behaviour that identified the offending character for manual intervention, was excellent, making it obvious to me as a user what the problem was and where to fix it without RTFM.  Where is can't be made automatic, can JabRef highlight possible problem characters allowing the user to decide (A Regex Search entry, written by someone smarter than me, is all I would need). \n\nNot the issue discussed, but related in a users mind as extra characters you have to deal with, issue #1153  means I have many junk characters in some imports and it would be nice to reverse there utf8-ASCII conversion on a per entry basis using `|Quality>Cleanup entries>`.  This is fixing the symptoms, but I mention it due the frequency the utf8-ascii corruptions experienced during file exchanges, in case it could be coded at the same time any changes deemed required are implemented. Not an expectation, just an idea.\n =||= @Siedlerchr: No. Obvious from the example `A {$\\Sigma_{i}$} {DSP} generator` which you do not want to save as `A \\{\\$\\\\Sigma\\_\\{i\\}\\$\\} \\{DSP\\} generator`\n\n@ajbelle Are the imports JabRef searches or BibTeX-files provided to you from colleagues and websites? For the first case, it would be good to now about as we should provide conversion automatically. For the second case one can think of having general import converters. The idea in the later versions of JabRef is though to implement this as \"save actions\", i.e., conversions/clean-ups that are always applied on saving so that HTML-encoded characters are never saved, but converted to LaTeX-sequences, when that is activated.\n\nClearly, JabRef could warn for characters that are unlikely to be what the user actually wants, as single #, unescaped & and % etc.\n\nIt is not, I believe, in the general case possible to figure out which two consecutive 8-bit characters actually should be combined to a 16-bit character. I see the point though and it would be nice if it did work...\n =||= @oscargus Oh yes, you are correct about automatic reverse conversion to 16-bit. Could it be coded for a user selected character sequence as manual correction requires you to know what the symbol should be? There are usually only a few mashed characters.  A suggested feature, requiring no reply as I doubt the team has time for such a specialist feature given the current philosophy.\n\n@oscargus  All of my offending imports are from downloaded .bib files, from reputable sources that should know better. I am amazed at the entry content and formatting served up as BibTeX and see JabRef as offering an authoritative implementation of the BibLaTeX standard. Specific to the 16bit encoding issure see #1153 .  I have tried to reset the encodings before import but it doesn't always seem to work on my Windows box. A cut and paste does not suffer the encoding translation problem.  I could be making a mistakes, but I am sure everyone at some time encounters this issue.\n =||= I should be quite feasible to, say, mark two characters, right-click and with some magic (`Character = 256*char1 + char2` sort of) convert those two to a Unicode character.\n\nIn the latest master there is an integrity checker that checks for an odd number of unescaped `#`. It will, if nothing else, detect half or so of fields with HTML characters in it. It should be possible to detect sequences looking like HTML characters as well, but it may require a bit more thinking to find the correct regular expressions (`&#[0-9]+;` (numbers) `&#x[0-9A-Fa-f]+;` (hex numbers) `&[A-Za-z0-9]+;` (named entities)) might work though when thinking about it, so adding an integrity checker that warns for (most?) HTML characters should be quite OK. Actually only the last one is required.\n\nBoth these might come in a master build in the near future. I'll update here if it happens.\n\nI'm surprised (but somehow not) to hear that bad .bib-entries are produced by knowledgable sources. If you happen to directly search from such a source in JabRef, just let us know and we'll at least add automatic conversion there.\n =||= The current master have checkers for an odd number of #-signs in a field and for any HTML characters, which should help in many of the cases if nothing else.\n\nI've also implemented the two 8-bit characters to one 16-bit character conversion, but when reading up it seems like it is only applicable to UTF-16. Do you have any example string that I can try on? Writing dd gives  \u6464 which is correct (`d = 0x64` and `\u6464 = 0x6464 = \"\\u6464\"` ), so it works but I am not sure that one will ever get that type of incorrectly converted characters in practice... It seems like the UTF-8 encoded version of that character is `0xE6 0x91 0xA4`, but then I do not completely follow the details... \n =||= And for example string: just copy from the field editor in JabRef and paste here. That _should_ work.\n =||= @oscargus I think you have it understood (better than me anyway). Since you said copy and paste I enclose examples from my file. I am not sure if this is what you wanted.\n\nMy encoding is set to utf-8 at all times in all editors. I do have entries from Endnote file import (original sources unknown) into various versions of JabRef. Due to their size and deeper coverage (including maths) the Abstracts are normally the problem. Embedded # have been a common annoyance (JabRef wouldn't save), along with the unbalanced {} which JabRef picks up.\n\nAs previously mentioned \u00b0 came in as \u00c2\u00b0  which is very annoying for me given I use it regularly as a special file marker.

Could it be that the encoding information is wrong there?\n =||= @koppor if your question is to me I always have JabRef UTF-8 and try ensuring the input file is UTF-8 (except when trying to figure out what is wrong). \n\nThe first line in my files is: `% Encoding: UTF-8`\n\nThe garbage content posted is a function of importing from many sources (including content obviously from pdf OCR) and are not necessarily a single translation fault. They simply list of the sort of garbage JabRef has to deal with, that could/will cause problems. The  list is not supposed to represent the original problem I identified, which has been fixed per @tobiasdiez.\n\nI have experienced situations where changing the encoding format to UTF-8 with Notepad++/Notpad2/CrimsonEditor... didn't seem to correct the import translation problem (but cut and paste on my Win7 box was fine!). I didn't have time to work out with certainty if the PFEs were actually changing the format, so did not report it as an issue with JabRef.  While I changed the file format by PDF I did not change the encoding line in the file, so I guess JabRef was being told it was CP1252 when in fact I had converted it to UTF-8. If true that would finally explain why I could never make it import without character corruption, and **maybe a clarification should be added to a help file somewhere.** Sorry if I have missed it in the manual.\n\nThe bottom line from my experience is that all users at some stage will get this sort of character corruption and if JabRef could help in any way that would be great. Reversing the one-way translation isn't usually possible I understand.\n\nIMHO @oscargus understands the situation best, and I believe he thinks everything that can be implemented has been.  I have therefore closed the issue, on the understanding no-one can see how to strengthen JabRef further.

Although not strictly required, it would be nice for symmetry.\n\nSuggestion: check if what JabRef believes to be a string, i.e., content between two # is a valid string label, if not make the user sort it out,", "Hm, I wonder why and where all this escaping and reformatting takes place on save. Didn't we decide to do no automatic reformatting of entries on save except for save actions. Critically, a closing curly bracket is entered `}`, but no corresponding opening bracket (Note: the first opening bracket is just to signal the beginning of the field value). Afterwards there is also a missing closing bracket.\n\nThis is not a problem in the parser, which just quits after  `author = {\\&}`. This is exactly what it should do since all content afterwards violates the BibTeX syntax. The serialization/escaping is just wrong and writes too few brackets. \n =||= I do not fully agree on the details. Assume a field in JabRef which reads `a#b#c`, this should be serialized as `{a} # b # {c}` (just as `#jan#` is serialized as `jan`, i.e. without `{}`). So that part is still OK (apart from the missing space for symmetry after the second #) and that will indeed load correctly, I tried the example in the first post with only characters inbetween the ## and it both saved and loaded OK. Hence, I conclude that the parser is checking for a string label (b or jan or 8211;&), where there are some formal requirements on how it should look.\n\nNow, as JabRef decided to use ## to separate field content from string labels, we can make the assumption that everything between two ## is a string label and then we put requirements on how that should look. A single #, as in #1188 is harder to actually know if it is expected or a problem.\n =||= We just tested this and it is still broken (but fortunately nobody else seems to have bumped into it). @oscargus: Do you maybe want to have a go at it?\n =||= I just tested this again.

If you have both bibtex and biblatex databases you'll not see the correct years and journal data in bibtex mode...\nThe other option is: You use `journal/journaltitle` and  `year/date` in the the custom type configuration. The semantics of this is, that either \"journal\" OR \"journaltitle\" is a required attribute of the type. But: This results in an entry editor which shows both variants, i.e, you'll have a journal AND a journaltitle field (but you'll only have to fill in one of them).\n\n@JabRef/developers and we should decide whether we support specific type customization for both modes.\n =||= "], ["1238", "Added integrity checker to detect HTML encoded characters in fields", "Oscar Gustafsson", "oscargus", "04/19/16, 04:17:56 PM", "Based on discussions in #1188 ", ":+1: LGTM\n =||= @oscargus in the url field, your detection now finds html encoded characters.

An error is raised stating that the format \"test\" is not specified within \"ReferenceParagraphFormat\" or \"ReferenceHeaderParagraphFormat\"\n   -> no list of reference appears\n\nExpected behavior:\n-> raise a similar error message but use the default values specified for \"ReferenceParagraphFormat\" and \"ReferenceHeaderParagraphFormat\" in http://jabref.sourceforge.net/OOPlugin-jabref.php as a fallback mode, in order to get the list of references compiled.\n# Explanation:\n\nI have several style files and often i switch between them. Furthermore I work with different documents, often I have to compile a small list of references. Compiling a list of reference for a new document often raises the error message above, because I forgot to import the reference format in LibreOffice. Even though JabRef is pretty clear what is wrong, it would be much more convenient from a user perspective, if the list of reference is compiled anyways, so they don't have to adapt the jstyle-file for each and every occasion.", "Makes sense. How do you think it should work in practice? Still show the dialog, but add: \"Using default format.\"? Show it every time the references are updated?\n =||= I had a look at the code and since it is based on throwing exceptions the fix is not straightforward (or at least not quick). What about two buttons in the warnings saying \"Use default format next time\" (which sets the format to the default in the program instance, so you will have to reload the style file to get the original one back) and \"Use style file format\" (which is maybe a bad name)?\n =||= Your two button solution would be definitely an improvement. From my perspective, a rephrased dialog with \"using default format\" that pops up at refreshing the database (everytime) would be the most convenient solution. Thereby, I don't have another option, I have to think about and choose. Its just a warning, that something is not correct, but the program keeps working. Furthermore the \"Use default format next time\" would probably require additional explanation (you have to reload the jsyle file to get the \"Paragraph Format\" defined in jstyle again ) which makes the warning as such more bloated.\n\nThese things said: If it is easier to implement a two button solution, I am perfectly fine with it.\n =||= This issue has been inactive for half a year.

But this is not a problem of the medline, but of the RIS importer which handles this incorrectly.\n\nEdit: Maybe we should rename the \"Medline\" importer to \"Medline XML\" imported to make this somehow clearer... \nMoreover it should be investigated whether the \"MEDLINE RIS\" format is standard RIS or if there are differences...\nAnd last but not least: We should check whether we have a defect in the RIS importer so that only one entry per RIS files gets imported.\n =||= @buhtz However, to solve you problem you have to change your workflow slightly: If you export not to \"medline\" but to \"XML\" format you'll be able to import more than one entry correctly using the \"Medline\" or \"All Formats\" importer. \n =||= I tested the RISImporter if it only imports one entry, but it correctly imports all entries.

I'm grateful for any help! =||= So, JabFox is now converted to Web Extensions and thus we can start thinking about versions for Chrome/Vivaldi/Opera and Edge. A few things we have to decide:\r\n\r\n*How should these add-ons be named?*\r\n- Option A: give each extension its own name, depending on the browser. For example,\r\n  - JabFox for Firefox\r\n  - JabRome for Chrome\r\n  - JabValdi for Vivaldi\r\n  - JabEdge for Edge\r\n\r\n- Option B: call them in a generic way, say \"JabRef in the Browser\" or \"JabRef Connector\"\r\n\r\n*How to structure the development?*\r\nAlthough most browsers now support some version of the \"web extensions\" framework, some minor adjustments have to be made for each browser. Moreover, the build chain is not the same for each browser. \r\n- Option A: Create separate repositories for each browser-version that fork the current version (JabFox) and make the browser specific adjustments there. In this way, we can use the magic of git to sync changes.\r\n- Option B: The same as A but use branches instead of separate repositories.\r\n- Option C: Different folders in the same repository for each browser-specific version and use a build script to sync them.\r\n\r\nI have a slight preference for options 1.A and 2.A or 2.B. @JabRef/developers what do you think? =||= If we want to promote the name JabRef we should probably aim for a generic name including JabRef, otherwise some neologisms are also fine.\r\nRegarding the development: I think this is really up to you as you are the main driver in the development right now. I guess it makes sense to not split them up into 3 different repos if the changes are not significant. Maybe branches are the easiest way to sync the code from master.  =||= Thanks for the feedback. On second thought, I also prefer a generic name. Let's brainstorm a bit:\r\n- JabRef Web Importer\r\n- JabRef Importer\r\n- JabRef in the Browser\r\n- JabRef Connector\r\n\r\nMore ideas? =||= As name I would prefere a simple and generic one like _JabRef Connector_ (this is known by Citavi users for example).\r\n_Web_ is an outdated term.\r\n_Importer_ is wrong because the AddOn is an exporter exporting data out from the browser.

", "About new developers:\nUsers may also be developers. Example: During the \"Translation challenge\", while asking only for translation (i.e. no programming skills), I got in touch unexpectedly with 2 java developers and one graphic designer (@koppor has their emails). So, they are developers around! Hence, I believe the issue is more about how to make them contribute. Suggestion:\n- send emails to the mailing list to ask for specific developments, or for specific skills (e.g. GUI design). Post on blog too? I can help in writing them down.\n\nAbout more feedback from users:\n- Advertise that X issues reported by users have been solved in the last Y days (to show that it is worth to report issues). I can help in writing them down.\n- When a new feature is implemented, advertise it on the blog and mailing list, asking for testing. That will also improve the overall quality of JabRef (more bugs found).  I can help in writing them down.\n- Open discussions on the mailing list about JabRef. Currently, the development team mostly reply to users' emails. The development team could (should?) also send emails to the mailing to ask users for feedback and initiate discussion (e.g. redesign of the menus, preferred keyboard shortcuts).\n\nAbout more users:\n- Write \"case studies\", showing how JabRef is used in everyday life in a library, a research team, etc. We could contact people who have already written about JabRef for a specific piece of text (search the web for it).  Could be written by users (ask them for contribution on the mailing list).\n- Show that JabRef is already widely used, by publishing the download statistics, the list of donations, etc.\n- Get (recent versions of) JabRef in the main Linux distributions.\n- Show that previous drawbacks of JabRef are gone (list of drawbacks in the survey). Each time one is overcome, advertise it.\n- Drive the development based on the needs of numerous users (i.e. not only solving reported issues). I do not mean that it is not done at the moment; I mean that this should be made more explicit.\n =||= I really like the idea! In fact I got into Jabref as a user, because the department I chose to write a paper, recommended JabRef. \nAnd I know that other departments/professors at my university (University Paderborn) use JabRef.\n\n> Use JabRef as a tool for tutorials about literature management, scientific work, etc.\n> make sure your university library provides courses about JabRef in addition to other popular tools\n> make sure your university lists JabRef next to the other tools on their homepage or wikis\n\nI am sure that this would be a nice idea. \nMy university is already providing several courses for topics going from traditonal  MS Office to LaTex, Photoshop etc.. I like the idea \n\nMabye it would also be nice to get some  kind of  official \"certificate\" for your CV, for developing/contributing to JabRef. \n =||= To encourage universities and libraries to use JabRef (or at least link to us) in their tutorials on scientifc work and literature management it might be helpful to provide some \"reference tutorials\" or a set of free presentation slides introducing JabRef and its main features.\n\n> Mabye it would also be nice to get some kind of official \"certificate\" for your CV, for developing/contributing to JabRef. \n\nAnd of course some JabRef shirts, mugs, buttons and stickers :wink:\n =||= I also think we need to provide more resources to help users and librarians with JabRef (I mean even we developer discover \"hidden\" features which are only documented in the code). Looking at this [comparison of bibliographic manager (in German)](https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/doc/1271693/1271693.pdf) the only clear disadvantage of JabRef is exactly in the outreach. See Citavi for example\n\n> Kurzanleitung (quick start tutorial)\n> Handbuch (manual)\n> Handbuch zum wissenschaftlichen Arbeiten (manual about working scientifically)\n> Filme und Animationen (films and animations)\n> sehr gute kontextsensitive Hilfe (anpassbar / editierbar) (contexted base help)\n> Forum\n> Ticket-System\n> Chat\n> Trainier-Netzwerk\n\nhttp://help.jabref.org/en/ gives a good reference for looking up specific features but doesn't provide a quick start introduction.\n =||= We have a German user manual. Should we integrate it into the help (refs https://github.com/JabRef/jabref-usermanuals/issues/1)? Should we convert it into slides? - We could use [odpdown](https://github.com/thorstenb/odpdown) if we are too lazy to use PowerPoint or [latex-beamer](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/beamer).\n =||= Next semester the library of University of Bamberg, Germany, will also provide a tutorial on scientific writing with JabRef. We hopefully can publish the material of this course as a tutorial on jabref.org\n =||= We are currently trying to focus on other things. :fire:\nWe will come back later to this topic, therefore closing adding [on-hold label](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label%3Aon-hold+) and closing the issue for now.\n =||= Recent forks can be investigated at http://forked.yannick.io/JabRef/jabref.

I also try the button on the side or shortcut (Alt+F) and it's the same behavior.\n@lenhard I know XP is really old, but it's my work computer, I have to live with what my IT departement give me. I try on the computer besides me, Win7, but Java is still version 7 and can't run Jabref... But I will understand if you drop support!\n =||= @melTr Can you try a recent version from http://builds.jabref.org/master/? Maybe this fixes your issue.\n =||= For me, it doesn't work.

I played so much with my prefs between my win and linux system that I can't remember what was the original. But if I choose a path specific to win (C:...article...) it works fine.

Usually one of the two sides is more \"cool\" at a certain point in time and API designers overuse it (see Java APIs designed at the turning of the millenial). Things are also not as simple as described in that stackoverflow post (and I could argue that the post says we should use unchecked exceptions).

I know this can be prevented by wrapping uppercase letters in braces, e.g. {T}he life cycle of {A}tlantic salmon, but this is too much work. Can JabRef help?\n> \n> A: JabRef has a setting that will automatically wrap all capital letters for certain fields in { } - this will make sure they are preserved in the LaTeX output. Under Options -> Preferences -> File -> \u201cStore the following fields with braces around capital letters\u201d, make sure the title field is included.

The css file probably needs some changes, I tried to set the visibilty but that didn't work out. @tobiasdiez Do you have some tips to handle this? \n =||= Sorry for my later answer. Normally you do this by using a PseudoClass `inactive` and change it with `pseudoClassStateChanged`, see for example https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/1438/files#diff-9a2c5dd139caeeb5e3e3eebb9adb24b3R92. Then you can style them via `.list-cell:active` and `.list-cell:inactive`.\n\nI would however only use the PseudoClasses for real styling purposes, for example `.list-cell:error` shows an error icon and sets the font color to red. Filtering should really happen on the basis of the viewmodel to which the listview binds (as you have done it right now).\n\nFor debugging UI issues, the tool Scenic View is very helpful (http://fxexperience.com/scenic-view/). I had some problems with running it separately and bind it to JabRef. However, adding it to the dependencies (Project Structure -> Modules -> Dependencies -> Add) and then invoke `ScenicView.show(scene);` somewhere works.\n =||= @tobiasdiez \nI have created FilterList to filter messages. But I have one problem to view correctly entries in Listview (have a look at my Screenshot). It only runs correctly if entries run out of the Listview. I have created a Test Button to test this behavior. This Test Button generates 1 entry in System.out, throws 1 exception and generates 1 entry in the Cache. This will be removed later.\nCan you help me and tell me, why Listview doesn't displays the entry correctly?\n\n![notcorrectview](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13031192/16559695/e877d2d2-41ee-11e6-831e-47dfbef4af97.PNG)\n =||= Sorry but I don't understand where your problem is. It looks like it prints the Test Cache message as well as the (first line of) the error stack trace. The system.out is ignored as I would have expected since you hide low priority messages. \n =||= Hi @tobiasdiez ,\nSo i will explain you, what is my problem.\n- The ListView shoulds show you all log entries and other entries like system.out and exception, if the button \"Development Information\" disable.\n- If the button on click, it shoulds hide all system.out and exception entries.\n  I have handle this will a filterlist. But the behavior by showing of entries is not correct.\n- Reproduct:\n  - Start error console\n  - Click on \"Test\" Button (1 time or more times)\n  - Click on  \"Development Information\" Button\n  - Click on this again\n    If you do so like i have written, then you will understand my problem.\n    Sorry about my bad english. I hope that you understand what I mean. I need you help or some tipp how i can clear this problem :-)\n\nThx you\n =||= Thanks for the additional description. I added a comment to ErrorConsoleViewModel which should help you to solve the problem. \n\nFor the next time, please try to add some tests first. There were quite a few things which could have been wrong:\n- Are the messages correctly passed to the T-Stream?\n- Do they have the correct priority?\n- Is filtering of the list working properly? \n- And finally: is is just a problem with the way how messages are displayed in the list view.\n\nThe first 3 options could have been ruled out by automatic tests. It would be good if you could add corresponding tests (which also require some positve refactoring, like making `filteredList` a (public) class variable and moving its initialization to the constructor).\n =||= There are three solution for this problem with create issue function:\n- **Solution 1:** Using of a GitHub API to create issue directly from JabRef with log in data, which user not like to do it. But I think, that way will be nice solution and GitHub will get more member (take a look in create issue dialog screenshot).\n  From customer: it will be nice this solution with a default account, but it will be not work.\n\n![create issue with github api](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13031192/17296487/cece12a0-5801-11e6-97d0-9b81c05e65ee.PNG)\n- **Solution 2:** Using OAuth2 to create issue directly from JabRef without log in data, but the user must give the application access in their account to use it, That will be difficult for some user.\n- **Solution 3 (This is my actual implement solution):** Create issue over default browser with help of saved log and exception information in clipboard.  (take a look in create issue pop up screenshot).\n\n![create issue with default browser](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13031192/17297508/4aabf744-5806-11e6-92b4-43193a6257b1.PNG)\n\nAfter close or click on OK Button. The default browser will open and show create issue site with default title (automatic bug report-\"current time with this format yyyyMMddHHmmss\") and a default issue description (JabRef version, operating system version, Java version). During the show of this create issue site, the log and exception information will be saved in clipboard. So the user can be paste it for detail information in issue description.

I think, that it is all okay ;-)\n =||= Please fix this bug:\n- When you activate the \"developer information\" button and then click \"Copy Log\" the exceptions will get hidden even though the \"developer information\" toggle button is still active.\n- Pressing the \"developer information\" button twice will show the exceptions again.\n =||= Please update your screenshots.\n =||= Please fix bug:\n- Open the developer information console\n- Click show \"Developer information\" toggle button to show exceptions\n- Click \"Ok\" button\n- Open the developer information console\n  \"Developer information\" toggle button is now deactivated again but the list view still shows the exception and the colour of the exception is black instead of red.\n =||= Any idea for a better icon? As pointed out in #1742 there is much more information than just errors here. It might even be better to skip the icon. (What about the information icon?)\n =||= Some suggestions:\n- I would use the [Console image](https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/5597/web-console-commandline-highlighted.png) instead of the red error symbol. Also move it above the list and add some description left to it. In spirit \"we now give you an insight into the inner workings of JabRef's brain. This might help to diagonize the root of problems. Please use the button below to inform the developers about an issue.\n- Rename \"create issue\" to \"report issue\". Move \"copy log\" button to the left to group it with the other buttons there. Rename \"ok\" to \"close\".\n- Do we really need a way to hide errors and warnings? I think every log entry should be shown to the user (i.e. no \"developer information button\"). I know, you spent a lot of time to implement it but I just don't see any advantages in having such a button.\n- Add a small non-obtrusive icon in front of every line which indicates if it is an error / warning / info. Similar to https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/5597/web-console-commandline-highlighted.png.\n =||= Some minor remarks and a bigger one with the icons, once they are fixed I'm fine with this.\nAll in all I really like how the console looks now. Good job \ud83d\udc4d \n =||= @tobiasdiez: I have merged and done feedback\n =||= Thanks for the update. The code looks better now. I have just a few more remarks, then this can be merged. @koppor pls do the final review\n =||= @tobiasdiez @koppor: feedbacks are done. Only this teestream thing, i am not sure how to fix it \ud83d\ude04 \n =||= Maybe someone else from @JabRef/stupro can help. @bartsch-dev maybe? It's a kind of architectural decision.\n =||= Try to use StreamEavesdropper instead of TeeStream\n =||= @tobiasdiez Is this what you meant with moving the code to the streamEavesdropper?\n =||= Yes this looks better.\nSo now I had a look at the code. If I understand it correctly, then there already exist two ways of listen to logger messages:\n- GuiAppender: listens to everything which goes through the Log4j API (i.e. `LOGGER.log(...)`) and writes it to Cache\n- StreamEavesdropper: listens to everything which goes through the System streams (`System.out/err`) and writes it to some streams\n\nAnd you added:\n- LogMessages: listens to everything and writes it some some internal list\n\nCould you refactor the code so that everything is only written \u0300to the internal list of  `LogMessages`, i.e. get rid of the Cache class and the printstreams in `StreamEavesdropper`. (And please add code comments to the classes, it was hard to understand what they actually do)\n\nAppendum for myself:\nSince there is essentially no code which still uses `System.out/err.printLn`, I would actually try to get rid of the `StreamEavesdropper` completely. Only problem: uncaught exceptions are not written via the Log4j interface. But this could be solved by setting the [default handler](http://stackoverflow.com/a/2344830/873661).\n =||= @tobiasdiez I have refactored and have done feedback.

Nice job :+1:\nOverall the code is also fine, just some minor refactorings needed.\nThe only thing I'm missing are tests, especially for KeyBindingsDialogViewModel.\n\nFor bonus points: the `KeyBindingRepository` is essentially a map between `KeyBinding` and a string representing the actual binding. In my opinion it would be better to replace the map by a list. That is `KeyBinding` contains directly `get/setActiveBinding` (besides `getDefaultBinding`) and then the repository is just a `List<KeyBindings>`.\n\nSpaces in the language keys should work as soon as https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/1426 is merged.\n =||= I addressed most of the comments. Unfortunately I wasn't able to figure out how to include a icon from the webfont in the `TreeTableCell` just yet.\n =||= Which Icon do you want to include? \nThe icons are organized in an enum here: https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/master/src/main/java/net/sf/jabref/gui/IconTheme.java\n\nJust search for the css code which is shown at https://materialdesignicons.com \nIf the icon is not already used you have to add it to the `JabRefIcon` enum.\nYou can find the cheatsheet showing the needed codepoints here: https://materialdesignicons.com/cheatsheet\n\nTo actually get an `Icon` you'll have to call `getIcon()` or `getSmallIcon()` on an enum element. \nE.g., `IconTheme.JabRefIcon.NEW.getIcon()`\n =||= The new changes are hard to review because many unchanged lines are marked as changed (probably line ending problems). But I really like the new Dialogs class (in particular :+1: for taking the time to write a meaningful documentation).\n\nRegarding the icon, you just set the font via `-fx-font-family: 'MaterialDesignIcons';` and set the unicode identifier as the text, see https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/1438. For some reason the icon codepoints differ from the ones used by JabRef (e.g. `IconTheme.JabRefIcon.MAKE_KEY` results in a folder icon) @matthiasgeiger do you know why?\nEdit: you also need to load the font as in https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/1438/files#diff-714bc6a7e9d4aca70ed8b733a7c75ed8R72\n =||= No idea why the codepoints differ... \n\nIs it possible to directly use the .css version of the font in JavaFX?\n =||= Any idea on why the icons are still not loading correctly?\n![missingicons](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15340757/15743826/74588b9c-28c8-11e6-83c1-62ab368fa200.PNG)\n =||= @tobiasdiez your version of the groups panel is showing me no icons as well..\n![noicons](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15340757/15746247/0d127ef8-28d6-11e6-888d-245677c5ef27.PNG)\n After some research I found this [website](http://www.guigarage.com/2014/10/integrate-custom-fonts-javafx-application-using-css/) explaining the issue in a UPDATE note at the bottom of the thread: \n\n> As I learned today the shown code isn\u2019t working in Java versions >= 1.8u60. Starting with this version the attribute \u201cfont-family\u201d is ignored and you have to use the real name of the TTF.\n\nSo I changed the attribute `-fx-font-family` to `-fx-font-family: 'Material Design Icons';` and with the spaces in the name it works on Java 1.8.0_91 and windows 7 64bit.\nThe question is whether `-fx-font-family: 'Material Design Icons';` also works on Java versions prior to 1.8.0_60. If not this would mean a JavaFX version of JabRef automatically requires Java 1.8.0_60 or above. Or if we use `-fx-font-family: 'MaterialDesignIcons';` then JabRef users running on Java versions above 1.8.0_60 won't see the icons.\nThis is also relevant when considering #1438 \n =||= For me (java 1.8.0_91, Win10) both versions display icons. However, only for `'Material Design Icons'` the codepoints are correct. So use the version with spaces. \n =||= Good work!\nI just have a few remarks about the general usage of view models and databinding.\n\nThe idea of this ViewModels is the following:\n- Expose fields (as properties) so that the view can easily bind to them (but only expose things you really need in the view)\n- Listen to changes to the underlying data and update accordingly. These changes are then propagated to the view via the binding.\n- Expose methods which modify the underlying data, the view never calls the logic methods themselves.\n- In the best case scenario, **you never access the view or its controls directly but for setting up the binding (so only in initialize()).**\n\nSo in your case you have two ViewModels:\nFor the whole dialog:\n- Expose bindingsTree and selectedItem\n- Listen to external changes (which is setKeyBindingsRepository) and update bindingsTree then.\n- Expose methods for resetting all keys, save changes, closing the dialog and relaying key pressed events to the selected item\n\nFor the item in the table: (KeyBindingViewModel)\n- Expose displayName and binding\n- No need to listen for changes since keybindings cannot be modified except in this dialog\n- Expose methods for changing the keybinding\n\nThe reason for this \"binding over everything else\" philosophy is that you can easily write tests. For example:\n\n``` java\nKeyBindingDialogViewModel dialog = new blabla();\ndialog.setRepository(some mocked rep);\nAssertEqual(expectedTree, dialog.bindingsTree);\n% If this test passes then you know that the correct things are displayed in the dialog (except if you forgot to bind the vew to `bindingsTree`)\n\nKeyBindingDialogViewModel dialog = new blabla();\ndialog.setRepository(some mocked rep);\nAssertCalls(mockedRep.resetBindinings(), dialog.resetBinding());\nAssertEquals(defaultTree, dialog.bindingsTree);\n% Check that the dialog relays the click to the correct method and updates view (only thing that can fail is again that the binding of the buttonclick is not bound to  dialog.resetBinding()\n\nKeyBindingDialogViewModel dialog = new blabla();\ndialog.setRepository(some mocked rep);\ndialog.selectedIBinding = some mocked binding view model\nAssertCalls(mockedBinding.setNewBinding, dialog.keyPressed(event))\n\nKeyBindingViewModel binding = new blabla();\nAssertCalls(repository.change(), binding.setNewBinding(event))\nAssertEquals(\"Ctrl + Alt + f4\", binding.KeyBinding);\n```\n\nCan you please try to add these tests?\n =||= I added some tests for the dialog view model\n =||= Nice! I only have some minor remarks about the naming of the tests and their general structure (only one assert per test). If these small issues are fixed, this PR can be merged from my point of view!\n =||= I refactored the test class.\nAlso I changed the FXDialogs to always show blocking dialogs and changed the way to create camel case bind names as there was a problem with the import of WordUtils.\n =||= Ok, ready to go from my point of view! @JabRef/developers what do you think?\n =||= Please rebase and remove the `BibTeX` localization key.

Why can I only have one personal list? Why can't I edit the external lists? Why do I need different windows to view external lists or JabRef internal list? What does the download button do since there is no hint in the dialog itself and is it really necessary to have it? Therefore I thought when porting the dialog I could also redesign it. The following dialogs mock ups concentrate all the different lists in one place and treat them as the same.\n\nThe first mock up treats all lists the same, a user can set up multiple personal journal lists or open some from this hard drive.

I noticed that some of these variables are only used in a single other class, thereby creating a dependency of that class to the gui package (which is very ugly). Example: The class `LatexFieldFormatter` is the only user of `GUIGlobals.LINE_LENGTH`, which prohibits the moval of `LatexFieldFormatter` into the `bibtex` package and makes that package transitively dependent of the `gui` package. Ultimately, if we fix this class and this dependency we can make the `bibtex` package completely self-contained and move it into logic. \n\nSeveral other variables in `GUIGlobals` are just used in a single other class. Therefore, I propose to move the variables closer to the scope of their usage where possible. This destroys `GUIGlobals` as a single point of configuration, but also improves our package dependencies. @JabRef/developers Are there objections to this?", ":+1: for removing GUIGlobals.\n =||= Yes, I fully agree with removing Globals. Maybe you can also check for obsolete  Settings/Variables.\n =||= Also think about whether they still make sense. Why do we need a line_length in that case anyway?\n =||= Ok, will do. @simonharrer: Honestly, I have no clue. But it is sometimes hard to decide if something still makes sense or not.\n =||= I would not refactor just because ofa metrics value getting better.\n\nHalf of the values (such as `INDENT`, `NUMBER_COL_LENGTH`, `EXPORT_DIALOG_COL_0_WIDTH`) look like configuration variables. We had the feedback that one main value of JabRef is the plethora of configuration options. I don't know whether these values also fall in that category or whether we should reduce the configuration options.\n\nI'm unsure whether we should switch to [Apache Commons Configuration 2.0](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-configuration/), where I really liked the 1.x series and the 2.x series seems even better.\n\nBack to topic: For each value, it should be decided if it's a configuration option or if it's just a constant to gain code readability.\n\nFor the former, we should move it to our configuration thing, for the latter, we should move it to the appropriate places.\n\nBeware: A configuration thing could also be used at one place only, but it really makes sense to have it stored at a central place to make users and programmers aware that this can be configured. `GUIGlobals.LINE_LENGTH` seems to be such a candidate.\n\nIf we want to keep that we programmers can configure JabRef code wise, we could introduce a new `Configuration` class or add it to our class `net.sf.jabref.Defaults`.\n\nSide comment: The whole configuration of [dwm](http://dwm.suckless.org/) takes place in the source files, not in ASCII configuration files.\n =||= @koppor: The thing is, all this stuff is not a configuration option, but a constant. The values are hard-coded and the variables themselves get eliminated and inlined during compilation. There is no position in the code that modifies their value and very often there is only a single line of code that reads their value. This applies to `GUIGlobals.LINE_LENGTH`, which is only read in `LatexFieldFormatter`. Despite its important sounding name, the variable matters to no other class in all of JabRef. Hence, it makes sense to move these variables closer to their actual usage.\n\nJust as a side note: This is not about metric values, but about the dependency tree of the system, which is arguably much more crucial.\n =||= > Because dwm is customized through editing its source code, it\u2019s pointless to make binary packages of it. This keeps its userbase small and elitist. No novices asking stupid questions.\n\n@koppor ? :wink: \n =||= @koppor has a point there. Whether it is a hard coded or dynamically loaded configuration option makes no difference when creating a class to configure the GUI. As long as the configuration options are still used they should reside in a single place, same as JabRefPreferences, so they can be made dynamically configurable if necessary later on. Otherwise, they will be scattered all over the app through inlining them. \n =||= @simonharrer: Maybe this should be decided on a case by case basis. Please have a look at #1409 and tell me if you feel that a certain variable is important enough to warrant a global scope. (And just as a side note: I only moved variables that were used in a single place once. If multiple classes used a variable, I left it in `GUIGlobals`)\n =||= This is really hard to review. Next time, please inline each variable in a separate commit so one can see its usages separately. \n\nOK:\n- BACKUP_EXTENSION\n- FRAME_TITLE\n- EXPORT/IMPORT_DIALOG_*\n- NUMBER_COL_LENGTH \n- TABLE_ROW_PADDING\n\nNOT OK\n- Colors: I would leave the colors there, as they have the potential to be made a config options and be used by multiple classes\n- Same holds for the variables controlling any output, e.g., indent or line_length - either remove them or leave them as configuration possibilities. Maybe even create preferences for them. \n- WIDTH_ICON_COL is used by multiple classes and in the gui globals, but WIDTH_ICON_COL_RANKING is inlined. This, I think hides their dependency between them (one being the special case of the other). \n- MAX_BACK_HISTORY_SIZE  seems to be an interesting setting which should not be hidden in some class underneath, but brought to the light/user/developer in some way. \n =||= Oh come on, seriously?

It seems like \"bundle parsing and writing of pure bibtex\", but, with the addition of new importers and exporters, responsibilities shifted and mixed over time. The big advantage we have now is that the package moved to logic, which means that there is a guarantee that it is independent of GUI code and it can be re-used for new GUI stuff with relative safety. If we move it out of logic (to importers or exporters) we loose that advantage. Ultimately, the goal should be to get the GUI independent code from the import/export package into logic as well.\n\nOut of topic: I just noticed the codecov report.

Now, editing an entry/and or saving it takes a couple of seconds (beforehands it was nearly instantaneous): see also https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/1332\n\nIs there a way for me to get the old binary 3.4 (18-05-2016) (unfortunately I've already deleted it).\n =||= Nevermind - found an older build.\n\nThe problem, however - of course - persists for the new version.\n =||= Yes, we are aware of this issue. This currently blocks the 3.4 release. \n =||= @tobiasdiez any idea how to fix this? This is basically the most critical blocker for the 3.4 release targeted tomorrow. \n =||= There are essentially two problems:\n- `revalidateGroups` method in `GroupsSelector` gets called after every change, which results in problems for batch edits. Solution: wait a few miliseconds and only redraw the group tree if no further revalidate request comes in\n- `revalidateGroups` blocks the main thread, so that editing an entry results in waiting time. Solution: make revalidation async\n\nBut I have no idea how to implement a solution. These Java workers and Swing threads are too cryptic for me.\n =||= The best way would be to use RxJava to implement this. \n\nThe quickest way is to implement something like this by hand through a scheduler somehow. \n =||= Could you try out the current master build whether this fixes your issue? In my tests, it worked correctly. \n =||= Thanks Simon!\n =||= Hmmm, I think this still hasn't be solved properly. With the new version 3.4 the performance is definitively better than build 3.4 (20-05-2016), but it is worse compared to build 3.4 (18-05-2016). Now, everytime an entry is edited and saved, all groups appear to be rebuilt, which takes a couple of seconds. Can you confirm this behaviour?\n =||= Could you reopen this issue (see above)?\n =||= I confirm the issue with V3.4 downloaded Saturday. I have a 7000 records database and 3 groups (publication, authors and keywords).\n =||= We tried to further improve the performance. Could you please try out the latest development version http://builds.jabref.org/master/? Thanks!\n =||= I can confirm that the performance has significantly improved with the new development version:\nJabRef_windows-x64_3_5dev--snapshot--2016-06-28--master--a24b544\n\nAdding a new entry works (nearly?) immediately (there might (?) be a minimal delay of max. half a second, but this is totally acceptable).\nI would say, this bug has been fixed now.\n\nOne thing to add: If \"Show number of elements contained in each group\" is activated, scrolling through the groups of my large database (>6000 entries; >900 groups) seems a bit slow (compare it to a videogame where the framerate is low). If it is not activated, you can smoothly scroll through the groups.\nSimilarly, if this setting is activated, adding an entry to another group (using drag'n'drop) has a small delay. If it is not active, it works immediately.\nThis, however, is another issue and definitely not a show stopper as the problem reported above. Maybe it is possible to improve this behaviour as well, but if not, it's fine I would say.\n\nThank you very much for this great new build!\n =||= Sorry about it, I could not use this version.

Such an event is sent from the method `BibDatabase.insertEntry`. The problem is that `DBSynchronizer` (and other classes in `remote` package) itself also use local methods such as `BibDatabase.insertEntry` or `BibEntry.setField` to update the local database. In this case the sent event should not trigger the SQL inserting/updating/deleting methods again (see https://git.io/vrHOw). But as I described in the code comments, if we remove the EventLocation it would not harm. It only causes a little redundancy.\n\n> All the metadata must be stored in the DB as well, including biblatex or bibtex mode...\n\nOkay, this is going to be implemented.\n\n> Also do not forget the save actions, as they have an influence on the values in the DB as well.\n\nUnfortunately I didn' t understand that completely. Now if you work on remote database you've still the possibility to save the file locally. Otherwise the changes are pushed by EntryEvents. Are there some other data which are involved within the saving process?\n\n> What happens if a change locally cannot be stored in the DB as there are conflicts?\n\nIn this mode the newest version is held by remote database. Changes are going to be pushed automatically and every time you push an entry your local database is also going to be updated (this process is going to be accelerated via hashing etc). So there is no scenario a conflict can occur except connection problems. But in this case the editor should restrict any editings (TODO). Or two people are working at the same time at one field. In this case the last push will win.\n =||= The save actions control stuff like that a specific field must be lower or upper case letters. Think about it: person A always uses lower case letters for the title, and person B uses always upper case letters for the title - what effect will this have on the database sync when basically the same data is used? They will create a lot of traffic if they work concurrently as the save of one will overwrite all the title fields of the other, and it will create conflicts. You can only overcome this if both know the correct save actions, and that is the reason why the save actions are stored in the metadata. \n\nRegarding resolving conflicts: sounds ok to be practical. It feels wrong, however, from my background with using version control systems. \n =||= I think it would be very profitable to unite the code for file-based exports with the code for sql-exports. For example, I really like the `immediately sync changes to the sql database` feature, which also would be nice for bib-files (similar to intellij's autosave). On the other hand some features which are currently missing for sql exports (like save actions or how external changes are handled) are already present for bib files. \nI did some refactorings in #1472 to make this unification easier.\n =||= Currently I'm working on save actions. As I see the remote synchronization differs a lot from the local saving of metadata and defaults (think about the relational structure). Unifiying the code would dissolve the `remote` package and a lot of things would have to be moved/passed through to `BibtexParser`/`BibtexDatabaseWriter` which would blow up those classes. Furthermore it would cost a lot of time which is not present.\n\nCurrently I'm going to implement this in `remote` package. If there is some time capacity left after the first release, we could make some considerations to implement this and other customer wishes.\n =||= @simonharrer @koppor It seems that ojdbc.jar is not longer available in maven repositories.\n(see http://central.maven.org/maven2/ojdbc/ojdbc/14/)\n\n`compile group: 'ojdbc', name: 'ojdbc', version: '14'` in `build.gradle` causes:\n\n```\nExecution failed for task ':tasks'.\n> Could not resolve all dependencies for configuration ':runtime'.\n   > Could not find ojdbc.jar (ojdbc:ojdbc:14).\n     Searched in the following locations:\n         https://jcenter.bintray.com/ojdbc/ojdbc/14/ojdbc-14.jar\n```\n =||= @obraliar Yes, they are no longer avaiable at the public maven repo, but Oracle has now its own repo. https://blogs.oracle.com/dev2dev/entry/how_to_get_oracle_jdbc\n\n However, it requires an account.

Now, in the context of the economic downturn, there is an even more pressing need to better guarantee the sustainability of health care systems. This requires that policy makers are informed about optimal allocation of budgets. We take the Dutch mental health system in the primary care setting as an example of new ways to approach optimal allocation. To demonstrate how health economic modelling can help in identifying opportunities to improve the Dutch mental health care system for patients presenting at their GP with symptoms of anxiety, stress, symptoms of depression, alcohol abuse/dependence, anxiety disorder or depressive disorder such that changes in the health care system have the biggest leverage in terms of improved cost-effectiveness. Investigating such scenarios may serve as a starting point for setting an agenda for innovative and sustainable health care policies. A health economic simulation model was used to synthesize clinical and economic evidence. The model was populated with data from GPs' national register on the diagnosis, treatment, referral and prescription of their patients in the year 2009. A series of `what-if' analyses was conducted to see what parameters (uptake, adherence, effectiveness and the costs of the interventions) are associated with the most substantial impact on the cost-effectiveness of the health care system overall. In terms of improving the overall cost-effectiveness of the primary mental health care system, substantial benefits could be derived from increasing uptake of psycho-education by GPs for patients presenting with stress and when low cost interventions are made available that help to increase the patients' compliance with pharmaceutical interventions, particularly in patients presenting with symptoms of anxiety. In terms of intervention costs, decreasing the costs of antidepressants is expected to yield the biggest impact on the cost-effectiveness of the primary mental health care system as a whole. These \"target group -- intervention\" combinations are the most appealing candidates for system innovation from a cost-effectiveness point of view, but need to be carefully aligned with other considerations such as equity, acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility and strength of evidence. The study has some strengths and limitations. Cost-effectiveness analysis is performed using a health economic model that is based on registration data from a sample of GPs, but assumptions had to be made on how these data could be extrapolated to all GPs. Parameters on compliance rates were obtained from a focus group or were based on mere assumptions, while the clinical effectiveness of interventions were taken from meta-analyses or randomised trials. Effectiveness is expressed in terms of years lived with disability (YLD) averted; indirect benefits such as reduction of lost productivity or lesser pressure on informal caregivers are not taken into account. Whenever assumptions had to be made, we opted for conservative estimates that are unlikely to have resulted in an overly optimistic portrayal of the cost-effectiveness ratios. The model can be used to guide health care system innovation, by identifying those parameters where changes in the uptake, compliance, effectiveness and costs of interventions have the largest impact on the cost-effectiveness of a mental health care system overall. In this sense, the model could assist policy makers during the first stage of decision making on where to make improvements in the health care system, or assist the process of guideline development. However, the improvement candidates need to be assessed during a second-stage 'normative filter', to address considerations other than cost-effectiveness.},\n  affiliation   = {Da Costakade 45, 3521 VS, Utrecht, The Netherlands,},\n  document_type = {Article},\n  groups        = {, Primary care setting, Simulation, Costs},\n  keywords      = {rank3},\n  source        = {Scopus},\n  url           = {https://www2.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84907412987&partnerID=40&md5=1a93e7fc3caaa5ae1affccb613abb516},\n}\n```\n\nI was reading above that \"groups\" are not yet supported in the shared DB support.

The latter is hard to achieve since we do not store the serialization of MetaData. If we want to, I'd have to make some additions to our MetaData objects. I could also store the comments between meta data and add them as a bunch at the end of the file, but then the relative position gets lost. Before I do more work, I'd like to clarify the following points:\n- Does the storage of arbitrary text above MetaData really matter?\n- Is it ok to delete comments if the entry below them is deleted?\n =||= Looks good to me. Just had some more or less minor remarks (mostly about the testing code). \n\nI think we don't need support for comments between JabRef metadata.\n =||= @tobiasdiez If not mentioned otherwise, I addressed your comments above.\n\nWe tend to differ when it comes to testing in general, though. I really prefer integration tests when doing anything with reading/writing. In JabRef, these things are inherently coupled. To implement this PR (write out user comments correctly), I also had to do significant changes to reading. So, as long as no overwhelming majority of @JabRef/developers pressures me to write unit tests, I will rather write integration tests.\n =||= LGTM. I think integration tests are more valuable.

This is completely handled by the keyword group. (It might even make sense to expand the class hierarchy chain and let `KeywordGroup` derive from `SearchGroup` since in the end it only a very specific search query is used.) \n =||= Thanks for the detailed explanation - makes sense. :)\n\nInstead of relying on the class, I would recommend to introduce an enum that differentiates the group types, and which is returned through a method getType which each class overwrites if necessary. \n =||= "], ["1475", "Remove codacy as its just meaningless right now", "Stefan Kolb", "stefan-kolb", "06/06/16, 05:41:42 AM", "NaN", ":+1:\n =||= "], ["1476", "Null exception when trying to import from external database with no *.bib open", null, "fishforbreakfast", "06/06/16, 01:42:48 PM", "JabRef version 3.4 on x86_64 Linux\n\nSteps to reproduce:\nStart JabRef.\n1.

Rather than \na key being linked to a group in \"jabref-meta: groupstree\" the group is attached to the individual entry, as in \"groups    = {culture},\", \n\nThe big disadvantage is that groups are no longer in a hierarchy but a independent. As the result, a key associated, say, with \"culture\", is associated with that term everywhere it appears in the database. So when I select \"culture\", hundreds of keys are elected that use the word \"culture\" in a different context or meaning. If I understand the situation there is no way now to avoid the hundreds of irrelevant links. \n\nThe issue is now to avoid duplicating the situation in the future. I find that if a BibEntries share a\nstring, they are viewed as the same. Since they are case sensitive, I can distinguish Culture, cUlture, cuLture, etc. Then go through all the keys selected by \"culture\" and re-associate them with one of the new names. Since this is hundreds of hours of work, I wonder if there is a better method.", "So the issue is when the group name is used multiple times in a large group hierarchy at different places? Like you have `GroupA -> culture, GroupB -> GroupC -> culture` and in this case the two groups will be merged falsely? Did I get your question right?\n\nJabRef should not be doing something like this. We need a step to uniquify the group names before they are converted. What do you think @tobiasdiez ? Or this this already done? I am a little bit uncertain if I have understood the question correctly.\n =||= Hi. This is exactly that.\n\nI usually use one group per project/paper, each one having subgroups with generic names, such as \"to_review\", \"introduction\", \"materials\", \"pathophysiology\" etc. With JabRef3.4, a given \"to_review\" subgroup contains the articles from all the \"to_review\" subgroups.\n =||= Since movement from JabRef 9.10 to 3.4 resulted in massive loss of information, I reverted to the former and recovered the jabref-meta: groupstree for each database. While I lack any expertise, it seems that the hierarchical structure of group names could be readily preserved. For example, here is a hierarchical group tree:\n\n  1\n   -A \n   -- a\n 2\n -B\n --a\n 3 \n -C\n -- b\n\nSo a bibliographic entry that is associated only the first \"a\", and with \"C\" and \"b\" would have the field:\n\n  groups = {1,A,a; 3,C; 3,C,b},\n\nIf this could be done, I recommend it.\n =||= Refs #628: \"Feature: Hierarchical Keywords\"\n =||= Okay, this is confirmed. \n\nA solution using like 1>A>a or something like this sounds reasonable.\n\nA quickfix is not possible. This requires a major rework as a lot of issues are caused by this.\n- the name and the keyword differ in static group\n- explicit group needs to now its context always to compute the correct key (or the other classes must ensure that the correct keyword is always set which encodes the group hierarchy)\n\n@tobiasdiez we should discuss this when you are back\n =||= I could implement that the whole hierarchy is always written in the groups field. But what about cases where the same group name is used on the same level, i.e. 1 > A > a and 1 > A > a with different entries? should this case just be forbidden upon creation of the group?\n =||= @tobiasdiez I think so: duplicate names should not be allowed for sibling groups, just like file names in a classic file system.\n =||= @tobiasdiez I don't get your example. Does that mean, that it is not possible to have the same group `a` associated with two different entries? (With `a` being nested in `A`, being nested in `1`). I would allow two entries belonging to the same group... Maybe, I did get something wrong.\n =||= I can confirm this bug for the build \"2016-07-13--master--304d280\".\n =||= @HainesB reported a similar issue at https://sourceforge.net/p/jabref/mailman/message/35303493/. Maybe, he is willing to test the fix as soon as we had time to implement it.\n =||= Come to think of it, maybe it is not quite that bad... In bug #1508 there was an example when repeating a group was undesirable:\n- Asthma\n  - Treatment\n- Diabetes\n  - Treatment\n\nBut repeating groups enables one to create such structure:\n- Asthma\n  - Asthma treatment\n  - Asthma diagnosis\n- Diabetes\n  - Diabetes treatment\n  - Diabetes diagnosis\n- Treatment\n  - Asthma treatment\n  - Diabetes treatment\n\nAnd such structure might be desirable.\n\nPerhaps a better (and easier) solution would be to make GUI aware of such possibilities (\"Add existing group as subgroup\", a dialog informing that the newly entered group name is not unique and asking what should be done)?\n =||= I think the above example is overly complex and has several pitfalls (i.e. deleting content from a groups one is not aware of that it is duplicated and one is therefore triggering unwanted side effects). Actually, the usecase illustrated above can be simply imitated by using three distinct groups asthma, diabetes and treatment. If you have this groups you can always select multiple groups and compute an intersection between them.\r\n\r\nTherefore, my proposal here is to keep it simple and use default behaviors, that people do expect (i.e. filesystem-like, without special cases like symlinks/hardlinks/etc). Thus, save groups simply like filesystem paths.  =||= But currently the groups don't behave like filesystem paths. There's no filesystem analog for \"have this file appear in any directory called \"treatment\" wherever that folder is on the disk.\r\n\r\nThe sample of @mpatas is fairly typical for me. I collect way, way too many references when I write a paper and I tend to separate them by theme so I know where to find them easily when I'm tangling with that theme. (edit: I know, keywords, but I like the visual representation of the tree) =||= (and the hardlinks behavior is already in JabRef and any other reference manager I can think of. A reference can legitimately and easily be in multiple reference groups, and no group has any special status as the \"actual\" location of the reference. Symlinks would indeed be confusing that way.) =||= When I download a file, to prevent a name clash the file is\nautomatically appended with an incremental number such as Alpha,\nAlpha-1, Alpha-2.\n\nCouldn't the group name creation process in JabRef be similarly equipped\nso that when a new group is created having the name of an existing\ngroup, an incremental number, perhaps no visible, is appended?\n\nHaines Brown\n =||= @tillschaefer \r\n> Actually, the usecase illustrated above can be simply imitated by using three distinct groups asthma, diabetes and treatment. If you have this groups you can always select multiple groups and compute an intersection between them.\r\n\r\nThat is true. Yet there are use cases of a somewhat different kind where this solution seems to be rather awkward. For example:\r\n\r\n- Biology\r\n  - Biochemistry\r\n- Chemistry\r\n  - Biochemistry\r\n\r\nIn general, grouping of references by topic will result in something like that for any multidisciplinary topic. Of course, one can make \"Biochemistry\" a group that is not a subgroup of either group, but that would seem to lose some of the benefits of hierarchical structure (for example, the ability to collapse the groups one is not interested in at the moment).\r\n\r\nIf done carefully, such structure with repeated groups should avoid any unintended side effects. Although, of course, done carelessly it could even result in cycles... =||= Hereby, I officially surrender in front of this bug. \r\nThe following steps are needed in order to fix the issue:\r\n- Static groups should match against the path in tree instead of its name, i.e. `Biology > Biochemistry` instead of only `Biochemistry`.\r\n- Migrate old groups to this new format.\r\n- Update a static group as soon as its position in the tree is changed.\r\n\r\nWhile each step in itself is not that difficult to accomplish, I have not the time to implement it right now. Sorry for the inconvenience caused!\r\n\r\nHowever, there are two workarounds:\r\n- Instead of creating a static group `Biochemistry` use a keyword group that matches `Biology > Biochemistry` in the `groups` field. You can have multiple keyword groups with the same name but different search pattern, so this should work as desired.\r\n- Use hierarchical keywords (e.g. `keywords = { Biology > Biochemistry, Chemistry > Biochemistry }`) and use the new automatic group feature of JabRef 4.0 (released soon) to generate a working groups tree \r\n````\r\n- Biology\r\n  - Biochemistry\r\n- Chemistry\r\n  - Biochemistry\r\n````\r\n =||= What about creating an additional uniqueID and a mapping from this ID to the displayed group name?\r\n\r\nIf a group name is already unique - use the name as ID.\r\nIf a group name is duplicated - create unique IDs `name1`, `name2` or sth else.\r\n\r\nIn the groups field the uniqueID should be stored. (This is a downside as there is a divergence between uniqueID and displayed group name - but I think in most cases groups won't be edited manually so this is not a real issue...)\r\n\r\nThe `ID -> display name` map should not be stored in some existing metadata but should be added to a new one. Thus, it should be possible to use the current implementation of the \"search logic\" by using the unique ID as search term. Also an automatic migration to the new format should be possible, and the groupstree is generally usable in older versions as well...\r\n\r\nOnly in the UI some bigger changes should be needed to show the display names...\r\n\r\nAs I have not looked at the groups code for ages... do I miss something? Or would this generally be feasible?\r\n\r\n =||= I haven't followed the whole history of the groups format, but it looks to me like most of these comments boil down to \"let's just go back to groups format 3\". If the point of groups format after-3 (4?) was that you could edit the group assignment in the entry itself without having to look up stuff elsewhere, none of the above seem to accomplish that.\r\n\r\nCan't we just copy the hierarchical tags idea for groups as suggested above? So something like\r\n\r\n* Asthma\r\n  * Treatment\r\n* Diabetes\r\n  * Treatment\r\n\r\nwould be represented as \r\n\r\n```\r\ngroups = { Asthma/Treatment, Diabetes/Treatment }\r\n```\r\n\r\n(or whatever other separator is deemed more appropriate) and have JabRef figure out on its own how that translates visually.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n =||= @retorquere To use this as an identifier for the groups would be possible, too. But this would cause either a lot of overhead if groups are moved in the tree, or would lead to inconsistencies between the actual position in the tree vs. the assumed position in the tree:\r\n\r\nLet's assume that the structure:\r\n\r\n- Asthma\r\n   - Treatment\r\n- Diabetes\r\n\r\nIs changed to:\r\n\r\n- Asthma\r\n- Diabetes\r\n   - Treatment\r\n\r\nThe entries assigned to this group would have the \"key\" `groups = { Asthma/Treatment }` although the \"Treatment\" group is now a subgroup of \"Diabetes\". And changing the keys of all affected entries would massively affect the performance in huge databases... \ud83d\ude1e \r\n =||= @matthiasgeiger then perhaps the desiderata \"easy to edit by hand with no more context than the reference\" (groups format post-3) and \"easy to keep consistent and well-performing\" (groups format 3) are at odds with each other... personally I still prefer format 3; the various downsides discussed above undo the benefits of post-3 from my pov. =||= I'm not sure whether I remember this correctly, but I think the main reason to change the group format was a more technical one, as the \"static\" groups are now implemented exactly the same way as all other groups: Now it is possible to simply perform a search in the background - as it is the case for keyword or freetext based groups. The \"easy to edit by hand and directly showing the groups in the entry\" was a nice side effect.\r\nBut perhaps @tobiasdiez could provide some more insights in this... =||= But if that was the aim, surely the current implementation doesn't accomplish this. The \"static\" groups as we had them in groups format 3 is not implemented in the new format (as per this issue). The new groups format implements *a* kind of static grouping, and it seems plausible it now uses the same search-based infrastructure as the other grouping methods did, but in the format-3 version even search-based groups could live nested under other groups -- why isn't that still possible? =||= As one stuck with format 3, let me throw in another consideration. When you\nhave databases having 15-20,000 entries as I do, a manual conversion of\ngroup names is prohibitive.\n\nHaines Brown\n =||= But would you do that manual conversion by hand? By script? Or using JabRef? Because only in the first case it would seem to be prohibitive. For the other two it would just be an implementation detail? I'd probably reach for option 1 only when my file is corrupt. =||= Just out of curiosity: When talking about \"groups format 3\" and \"groups format 4\", do you mean JabRef 3.x vs. JabRef 4.x? I thought the change in group structure happened between JabRef 2.11 and JabRef 3.x?\r\n\r\nOr are you talking about new changes in JabRef 4.x?\r\nOr is the \"groups format\" not related to the JabRef version? =||= I'm not sure how the groups format relates to JabRef versions; there used to be a \r\n\r\n```\r\n@comment{jabref-meta: groupsversion:3;}\r\n```\r\n\r\nin the Bib(La)TeX files created by JabRef, now there is\r\n\r\n```\r\n@comment{jabref-meta: databaseType:biblatex;}\r\n```\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n```\r\n@comment{jabref-meta: databaseType:bibtex;}\r\n```\r\n\r\nsince this is the first new format I've seen since `groupsversion:3` was depracated, I've been calling it `format 4`, but only because it's `3+1`, no other reason. I don't know what the internal name is the JabRef devs use for either of these formats.\r\n =||= Thanks for the clarification! =||= Mapping this to JabRef versions its \"up to JabRef 3.3\" and \"since JabRef 3.4\" =||= The main advantages of the new format are outlined in https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/629. The id-based strategy suggested by @matthiasgeiger should work but removes some of the advantages (at least for groups with duplicate names). The issue is not that a solution is not technically feasible but that I don't see an easy solution, i.e. a lot of time is needed to program it.\r\n\r\nMaybe I should stress the point, that the workaround above is very easy, has the same behavior as explicit groups and results in no performance loss or other problems (that I can see). The idea is the following. Assuming that you already have a tree with the groups `Asthma` and `Diabetes` and want to add two explicit groups `Treatment` as subgroups. Instead of creating `Threatment` as an explicit group (since this would lead exactly into this bug), we will add it as a keyword-based group working on the `groups` field and searching for `Asthma > Treatment` and `Diabetes > Treatment`.\r\nSo you would end up with the following tree:\r\n   - Asthma (explicit group, or whatever you want)\r\n        - Treatment (keyword group: field = `groups`, search text = `Asthma > Treatment`)\r\n    - Diabetes (explicit group, or whatever you want)\r\n        - Treatment (keyword group: field = `groups`, search text = `Diabetes > Treatment`)\r\n\r\nIf you now add an entry to the first `Treatment` group `Asthma > Treatment` will be added to the `groups` field, while for the second group you get `Diabetes > Treatment`. Hence only the correct entries are matched by each `Treatment` group.  In the end, you implement the solution proposed above by hand.\r\n\r\nNote, that if you still use an older JabRef < 3.4 you can simply change the explicit groups with duplicate names accordingly to this scheme (using JabRef, rightclick on group -> edit -> change to keyword group with `field = groups` and search text whatever you want - all your entries are automatically assigned to this new group). Now you can upgrade to later JabRef versions and don't have the trouble that groups are accidentally merged.  =||= I wonder, are we still doing something regarding this issue? Any actions planned?\r\n\r\nBecause as far as I can see, the groups format is pretty much stable as it is now. So I guess this issue can be closed. =||= Shouldn't this be kept open? Because the actual issue has not been fixed, there are only workarounds for it - as far as I understand. I, for example, opted to replace subgroup names that appear multiple times in my database with a new name that is based on both the parent group and the subgroup. While this certainly works, it is just a workaround. I think something that could help alleviate the problem a bit would be JabRef notifying the user that a specific group name has already been used (similar to the duplicate Bibtex key notification). This would not solve the issue, but I think it would be a very helpful workaround.\r\n\r\nFrom @tobiasdiez replies, however, I understand that solving the issue itself would require an awful lot of work, which is (currently?) not feasible, especially since there exist workarounds. My suggestion would be to keep the issue open, but maybe add a tag, that this is a longterm problem that may or may not be solved in the distant future (if such a tag exists). =||= yes, please keep this open. the problem can silently destroy your grouping. there is no warning issued to the creator of such a group. it just merges groups with the same name and this is not an expected behaviour.  =||= @AEgit @tillschaefer Thanks for the explanation!\r\n\r\nSure we can keep this open. And now I recall what we wanted to do here:\r\n - Implement a warning message if users create groups with duplicate names.\r\n\r\nI'll be optimistic and add this to the 4.0 milestone as well. Let's see if we can make that depending on how well the next beta goes. =||= @lenhard: Cheers, thanks a lot! Yea, I think the warning message would be very helpful. =||= A warning message is now shown.\r\nSadly a real fix of this issue requires a lot of time that currently none of the developers can invest.

However, when I export it as xml, the xml looks like this:\r\n```\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" standalone=\"no\"?>\r\n<b:Sources xmlns:b=\"http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/bibliography\" xmlns=\"http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/bibliography\" SelectedStyle=\"\">\r\n<b:Source>\r\n<b:BIBTEX_Entry>www</b:BIBTEX_Entry>\r\n<b:SourceType>Misc</b:SourceType>\r\n<b:Title>About Us</b:Title>\r\n<b:Author>\r\n<b:Author>\r\n<b:NameList>\r\n<b:Person>\r\n<b:Last>of Truth</b:Last>\r\n<b:Middle>Source</b:Middle>\r\n<b:First>Great</b:First>\r\n</b:Person>\r\n</b:NameList>\r\n</b:Author>\r\n</b:Author>\r\n</b:Source>\r\n</b:Sources>\r\n```\r\nShouldn't it show the author as a corporate author? =||= @mew1033  Yes, you are right.

The 2 goals of this revision is to improve maneuverability through the keyboard and streamlining hotkeys. Some related hotkeys like for the side panes were scattered across the keyboard, so we grouped them together. You might be wondering what has changed, so have a look at them:\n- Change default key bindings (have a look at the table below)\n- Add a hotkey for creating a new technical report\n- Add a hotkey for opening the OpenOffice/LibreOffice pane\n- Add \u201cPrint preview\u201d to the right-click menu\n- Improve group pane maneuverability by making groups selectable by arrow keys \n- Improve main table maneuverability by making \u201cTAB\u201d jump to the next entry instead of the next cell, \u201cSHIFT+TAB\u201d selects the previous entry\n- Resize the \u201cchange key bindings\u201d dialog to 500x500\n\n| Keys - new | Keys - old | Function |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| F7 | alt + f | Automatically set file links |\n| F8 | ctrl + shift + F7 | Cleanup entries |\n| alt + 1 | ctrl + shift + E | Focus entry table |\n| alt + 2 | ctrl + F9 | Toggle entry/preview editor |\n| alt + 3 | ctrl + shift + G | Toggle groups |\n| alt + 4 | F5 | web search |\n| alt + 0 | - | Open Openoffice/LibreOffice connection |\n| ctrl + shift + F7 | ctrl + f4 | Synchronize file links |\n| ctrl + shift R | - | Technical report |\n| - | alt + P | Print entry preview |\n| - | ctrl + alt + T | Hide/show toolbar |\n| - | ctrl+P | Edit preamble |\n\nAs you can see we moved related functions together. \u201cF7\u201d is now affiliated with file links, hence we changed key bindings if they contained \u201cF7\u201d but weren\u2019t related to file links.\nAlso we moved all side panes together by changing them to \u201cALT+(1,2,3,4,0)\u201d. By doing so we hope to improve the accessibility, because now you don\u2019t have to remember all kinds of key combinations for side panes, only which number stands for your desired pane. On a side note: Open OpenOffice/LibreOffice connection was added to this family due to being a side pane.\nThe hotkey for \u201cEdit preamble\u201d was changed due to normally being the hotkey to print.\nThe new hotkey for \u201cNew technical report\u201d was requested by some users that use it frequently, so we added a key binding.\nWe removed the hotkey for \u201cHide/show toolbar\u201d due to being not of any imaginable use for users.\nWe removed the hotkey for \u201cPrint entry preview\u201d due to some conflicts with others and the fact that this function wasn\u2019t really used that often by users. But we didn\u2019t remove it completely, we added it to the right click menu.\nWe removed the hotkey for \"Edit preamble\" due to being a seldomly used action that doens't require a hotkey.\nWe resized the \u201cchange key bindings\u201d dialog due to being too small for some descriptions.\n\nFor questions about the functioning or suggestions for improvements please use the discussion forum.

Is it correct, that the \"global search\" window will be abandoned? I have no idea whether it is causing any conflict with the current implementation of the search mechanism, but I am one of those who is using it rather extensively. \n\nThere are two scenarios, where a global search is useful:\n1. Often I create a separate bib file for a project (e.g. a journal article), where I put all related papers. Some of them are of interest just for this project and are not supposed to be part of my database core (e.g. newspaper articles). Hence, I often use search queries that include results of the core and project related file\n2. I have a bib file for papers which I use in a certain context, but that haven't been read thoroughly yet. Some of them will eventually be moved to the 'core database'. Also in this case I use a global search to find results within both bib-files.\n\nBoth scenarios could be managed by creating groups, and if global search gets abandoned, I will certainly do. However, I like the tab based style of several bib files very much, because I don't have the feeling that my project related articles get lost in my huge database with thousands of entries\n =||= :+1: for keeping the global search window. Please readd it. @bartsch-dev There are many JabRef users having more than 10 bib files. They do not want to click through all 10 files for each search.\n =||= Another aspect: What happens if the horiztonal space is not enough to display all icons and the search bar? Will the searchbar be displayed beneath the icon bar? \n =||= Based on another issue the minimum width of the window is already around 1000 pixels (depending on look-an-feel, OS, etc), so it is crucial that it will fold.\n\nBut it indeed looks promising!\n =||= if the window is too small for the toolbar it will now wrap between the normal buttons and the searchbar.\n\nThe search result Dialog will now remember its location; the global search has a shortcut (ctrl+shift+f, #573); enter in the result dialog will select the entry in the BasePanel (#617); the Reuslt window is cloasable with ctrl+w if fdocused (https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/573#issuecomment-232284156); and the result dialog won't stay at top anymore if the MainFrame is focused and they are on top of each other.\n =||= Please resolve conflicts.\n =||= > enter in the result dialog will select the entry in the BasePanel\n- I have two databases open and search for a keyword\n- I open the global search and it finds my result entries from both databases\n- I press enter on an entry and it focuses the correct tab but <b>it always selects the first entry in this tab</b>\n\nEDIT: It does focus the correct entry if I am already in the right tab, but if it has to focus a different tab it always selects the first entry.\n\nDid I missunderstand the sentence or is this a bug?\n =||= Should be fixed now!\n =||= Is it possible to work on the global search in this PR, too? \n- [x] The shortcut ctrl+shift+f should focus the search field if it is empty (instead of doing a globally searching the empty string)\n- [x] ESC in the global search should focus the search field.

On top of that `jabref.globals` should contain bootstrapping classes and global information (`JabRefMain`, `Defaults`, `Globals`, etc.). `jabref.preferences` should bundle the classes `JabRefPreferences` and `JabRefPreferencesFilter`. `jabref.cli` should bundle the CLI classes (already a top level package). According to the model, the only allowed dependencies in jabref should be:\n\n`jabref.logic` -> `jabref.model`\n\n`jabref.globals` -> `everywhere`\n\n`jabref.gui` -> `everywhere`\n\n`jabref.cli` -> `jabref.preferences`\n`jabref.cli` -> `jabref.globals`\n`jabref.cli` -> `jabref.logic`\n`jabref.cli` -> `jabref.model`\n\nThis is an open discussion, any comments are welcome!", "Some comments/questions, primarily based on the experience from #1593:\n- Where will the `String`constants from `Globals` end up? These are:\n\n``` java\n    public static final String FILE_FIELD = \"file\";\n    public static final String FOLDER_FIELD = \"folder\";\n    public static final String DIR_SUFFIX = \"Directory\";\n    public static final String SIGNATURE = \"This file was created with JabRef\";\n    public static final String ENCODING_PREFIX = \"Encoding: \";\n    public static final String COL_DEFINITION_FIELD_SEPARATOR = \"/\";\n    public static String NEWLINE = System.lineSeparator();\n    public static final String SPECIAL_COMMAND_CHARS = \"\\\"`^~'=.|\";\n```\n\nIt seems like `FILE_FIELD` is so established now that it is not needed to be in `Globals` and we can use `\"file\"` directly. `FOLDER_FIELD` is one used in one place in the code and I'm not even sure that the code does something useful. `DIR_SUFFIX` can probably be hard coded as well. `SIGNATURE` and `ENCODING_PREFIX` should be able to move to somewhere in `logic.export`. `COL_DEFINITION_FIELD_SEPARATOR` should, out of necessity, move to `FieldComparator` (as the other uses are in gui). `NEWLINE` is far from obvious to me how to handle. `SPECIAL_COMMAND_CHARS` could probably be moved to, say, `StringUtil`.\n- Assuming that `logic` should not know about `preferences`, I assume that means that it is not even OK to pass the complete `Globals.prefs` to any  `logic` method? (Hence, #1593 isn't really the solution.) However, I see one major issue here and it is `layout` which may need many different values from the preferences. I do not see it feasible to pass each individual possibly used preference value needed for any of the methods, as these are needed in a lot of places and there will be many functions to add arguments to, although in most cases the arguments will not even be of any value. I had a similar discussion regarding injection of `JournalAbbreviator`, but this may be even worse...\n\nIn general I think the general idea is really good though, but as I said, I do not really see how `logic` can not know about preferences. Also, now, there are specific preference classes, such as `SaveSessionPreferences` or `OpenOfficePreferences`, which reside in `logic` and I just cannot see where they should be. If they are in `preferences` they can not be used in `logic`, if they are in `logic` they cannot access `preferences`.\n =||= Where should `event` end up?\n =||= Thanks for your feedback!\n\nThe `event` package is relatively simple. Since it is tightly coupled to model classes, which throw the events, it should be located in the `model` package (`model.event` probably). This should be possible out of the box right now.\n\nRegarding the constants in `Globals`: I think we should keep constants and not use hard coded values, even if `FILE_FIELD` is sufficiently established. If possible, we can try to move some constants closer to their actual usage, but that really depends on each constant individually. We can check the usages and if, for instance, a constant is only used in `logic.export`, then it can be moved into `logic.export`. If it is used in multiple places, it should just stay in `Globals` for now. If `FOLDER_FIELD` doesn't really do anything useful, we could maybe just delete it.\n\nRegarding preferences: The (very very long-time) plan is to turn `model` and `logic` into an API and, therefore, it should be free from preferences. Any configurations needed in these packages should be passed as parameters. However, I have to admit that I cannot provide a good plan for achieving this at the moment. @simonharrer Can you perhaps shed some light on how we should proceed here? For now, I think it is ok, if we just try to not to add too many new dependencies between `logic` and `preferences`. #1593 is still a step in the right direction, I think, because it decouples calls to `Globals`, which is also something we need to do. The coupling to `JabRefPreferences` is still there, but we should take one step at a time. \n =||= :+1: for moving the event package to the model.\n\nI would create a class with all the standard field names, and put this in the model. Then, this could be used within the model as well.\n\nRegarding preferences: I think, too, that this should be an evolutionary process with the ultimate goal of having no preferences in there. I do not have a plan that fits all situations. What would be best:\n- GUI calls Method from Logic, and passes the preference values as parameters.\n- If there are many parameters, create a class.\n- As the logic should not write preferences, these classes can be made immutable.\n- If the preferences influence the state of the logic somewhere, and there is not yet a nice API available, we have a problem. In any case, we need to make this explicit that there is a dependency. Either we pass the preference value for each call, or we store it somewhere and need to update it whenever it changes, which may update even more stuff. We can solve this using the observer pattern so that in case of any preference changes, the state of the logic will change as well. If only one or two methods are touched, I would pass the parameter, but if this would touch a lot more methods, we should use the observer pattern instead.\n =||= There is one more thing I am wondering about: How should the GUI access preferences? Should it directly read preferences from `JabRefPreferences`, i.e.: \n\n`String defaultLabelPattern = prefs.get(JabRefPreferences.DEFAULT_LABEL_PATTERN);`\n\nOr should it reuse more specific preferences classes that we introduce at various places, i.e.:\n\n```\nLabelPatternPreferences labelPrefs = LabelPatternPreferences.fromPrefs(prefs);\nString defaultLabelPattern = labelPrefs.getDefaultLabelPattern();\n```\n\n@simonharrer, @tobiasdiez, @oscargus : What do you think? At the moment the GUI does everything in the first style. Should one of the two be preferred? Or does it not matter? This is relevant for some of the refactoring work that Oscar is currently doing.\n =||= I actually didn't understand earlier that the preferences are written to different locations as is discussed in #1626. I thought it was enough to have separate keys and everything was fine... This is then clearly relevant for moving/injecting preferences from/in logic. (Or am I missing something more?)\n\nI'd say that the GUI code should access Globals.prefs and the logic code use a special class. However, sometimes it is convenient to use the same class for the GUI. For example, the OO/LO connection has a very distinct set of preferences so one might just as well only work with those. In my recent code I think I mix a bit. Try to use a special preference class, but where it is simpler, I go with Globals.prefs.\n =||= The idea of the specific preferences was to avoid cluttered method signatures, right? \nI.e., `doTheWork(SomePreferences withThisPrefs)` instead of `doTheWork(String pref1, boolean pref2, int pref3, ...)` especially in the case that preferences are used during initialising an object (which, however should be avoided to simplify pref changes :wink:).\n\nIf we stick to those \"specific preferences\" and do not use this only as an intermediate step to methods with explicit parameters, I would use the \"specific preferences\" in the UI, too.\nHiding the prefs key and using the method for a subset of the global preferences seems to be more consistent and simplifies changing the keys a bit (though with current IDEs this is not a real issue ;-))\n =||= Since we have a consensus on the high-level architecture, I now documented it in https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/wiki/High-Level-Documentation\n\nTherefore, I am closing this issue.

However, there is one immediate issue that we need to consider: If we decouple a class completely from `Globals` and `JabRefPreferences`, for instance by just passing String values read from the preferences as parameters to the constructor, we might run into refreshment bugs. This means that if someone changes the preferences via the GUI, the change might have no effect on JabRef, since the value is not re-read every time it is needed. The obvious solution that comes to my mind to avoid this is the Windows approach: Always restart JabRef for preferences changes. What do @JabRef/developers think?\n =||= > The obvious solution that comes to my mind to avoid this is the Windows approach: Always restart JabRef for preferences changes.\n\n:weary: I don't like this. It already unnerves me that in some occassions a restart is needed. \n\nI don't have the time (and I don't want to :wink:) check this whole PR... but using params with the current settings, or recreating the object instances on pref changes is not possible?\n =||= @matthiasgeiger At least I do not really know where every preference is needed. And I also do not know if it is possible to just recreate certain parts of JabRef on demand, without a restart of the program (because JabRef is just so tangled and that is what we are trying to improve here). @oscargus: Can you perhaps look at all occasions where you removed `Globals` and `JabRefPreferences` in this PR and try to guess if there might be problems when preferences are changed?\n\nCould the event system be a way to make this work? (Think of a `PreferencesChange` event)\n =||= It is definitely a problem for `HtmlToLatexFormatter`, but maybe we should remove that support anyway. It may be a problem for the AutoCompleter (not sure where the preferences are used there, if they are just passed on to LayOut, in which case it is used for formatting the File-formatters, so probably not an issue).\n\nThere are some way to alleviate this though:\n- In `JournalAbbreviationLoader.getRepository()` the `JournalAbbreviationRepository` is only generated once. Here one can probably check if the preferences (configuration object) have changed, and in that case generate a new `JournalAbbreviationRepository`. This would improve the behavior compared to the current one (before this PR).\n- In `CustomExportList` the `JabRefPreferences` are passed to every call. This is something I was considering fixing and only use the one from the constructor, but it is actually a feature here.\n\nAs it is said that this is an evolving process, what remains to be done? I think dropping the preferences from `HtmlToLatexFormatter` if nothing else. There are some clear cases where a specific preferences class and the generic one are both passed. This is something for later. Anything else?\n =||= Though it is an evolving process, we should not introduce bugs in the meantime :-) In `HTMLToLatexFormatter`, you can remove the preferences configuration (which you already did). \n\nAs for the `AutoCompleter`, it should really still work and update as before the PR. So, if it doesn't at the moment you should implement an update of the preferences for the `AutoCompleter`, e.g. by recreating and resetting the object if changes in the preferences occur. \n\nThe whole rationale is: JabRef should behave in the same fashion after this PR as it did before (with the exception of `HTMLToLatexFormatter`). Architecture refactorings should not change functionality. It is quite hard for me to guarantee this, so it really depends on your intuition and testing.\n\nIf you find it too hard to implement a preferences update at a certain position, it would be better if you just reverted the dependency refactoring for that position. Then we can have a closer look at the specific dependency in another PR.\n =||= Regarding `AutoCompleter`: it is currently (in the `master` branch) not updating when the preferences are changed. This PR actually makes it easier to update (although it is indeed behaving the same as before at the moment).\n =||= Ok, then LGTM!\n =||= To be more precise: `JournalAbbreviationLoader.getRepository()` used to get `Globals.prefs` on the first call. Now it is passed as an argument. Hence, any relevant changes in the preferences between starting (where e.g. `AutoCompleter` is initialized with the current `Globals.prefs` and later call `getRepository()`) and the first actual call to `getRepository()` (not sure when that is, it might be at start up as well and then there is no change) will be ignored now. However, the fundamental issue that any subsequent changes to the preferences after `getRepository()` is called first are ignored is still the same.\n\nI think that the idea of a `PreferenceChanged` event is really the way to go.

Thus the workflow is not changed (at least not with this PR).\n =||= Is generally fine for me. \n\nOne remark: There are currently two different workflows for the \"SearchBasedFetchers\". \nNormally one hits the \"Search\" button after inserting some search query and a list of found entries is presented, after selecting the desired entries they are imported. \nHowever, at least for the GoogleScholar fetcher there is another dialog presenting more details to \"preselect\" the entries which should be shown in the list of found entries (I think the intention is to reduce the amount of queries).\n\nIs the proposed \"shallow\" search method used in this case? Or is this difference in the workflow currently not really covered, yet?\n =||= I think the workflow is supported by the two methods `performShallowSearch` and `performDeepSearch`. I assume that the dialog is presented if `performDeepSearch` is present. I think that one needs an additional class having only `performShallowSearch` and a second one containing both methods.\n\nMy concern is that the intermediate results might not be available as bibtex entries, but as HTML only. I think, the `ImportInspectionDialog` was used for that, wasn't it.\n\nWhat about error messages? I assume the aim is to use `LOGGER` only and to use the error console? I used to like the GUI dialogs showing errors, but OK for me to remove them to improve the code.

He will do a PR on your repo, is that OK, @tobiasdiez?\n =||= For the FulltextFetcher it would be awesome if the FullText finding could be run as part of a Cleanup operation, e.g. globally finding fulltext for all entries.\nThis should be kept in mind\n =||= Thanks for the feedback. \n@matthiasgeiger, @koppor  yes I thought about covering the two-stage search by the deep and shallow methods. Maybe this is not the best idea and one needs a different approach for the Google search. Thus for now I would concentrate on the simple fetchers which get all the metadata in one query.\n\n@koppor The result from the server is of course HTML (or XML, JSON,...). It is the task of the fetcher to translate the response to something meaningful, i.e. to `BibEntries`. I expanded the arXiv fetcher to outline how this works (in fact the arXiv fetcher now understands free text queries and not just ids). I also included a way to notify the caller about errors...by, well, throwing exceptions (with meaningful error messages). Maybe the fetchers also need to post some events to let the GUI know about the progress. \n\n@Siedlerchr Good idea. However a bit out of the scope of this PR. Could you file a new issue for it? Thanks!\n\nSo the plan for this PR is now to use the new interfaces parallel to the old code (so that I don't have to rewrite every fetcher).\n =||= So PR is ready for review. \nThe new fetcher can now be included via a wrapper. In this way the fetcher can be transformed to the new interface step-by-step without the need to refactor everything at once.\n\nIf I get the ok for merge, then I (or @zellerdev) will move `HelpFiles` to logic and thereby fix the failing architecture test.\n =||= Many of the current fetchers will only fetch a limited number of entries. Typically based on user input. How is that going to be handled here?\n =||= Whereas I think the interface redesign is a good thing, I'd like to throw a few things for discussion.\n1. The interface hierarchy is too complex in my opinion why not just use:\n   - WebFetcher: Has two methods for SearchBasedFetcher & IdBasedFetcher\n   - IdFetcher\n   - FulltextFetcher\n\nThe web fetcher hierarchy seems artificial to me. Why do we ultimately need one method interfaces?\n1. I really don't like the effect that we merge all fetchers into one class, e.g. your ArxiV.java class.\n   Some fetcher are complex enough on their own so why create new 1000 lines classes being capable of searching, id fetching and full text retrieval. Let us just use 3 classes for the three types of fetching.\n =||= On another note: I don't think that `HelpFile.java` belongs into the logic package.\n =||= @oscargus Right now every parameter has to be passed to the fetcher via the constructor. Maybe it would make sense to include the number of results as a method parameter. Right now I don't have a feeling on how many fetcher actually support this (or if a common fixed value of say 30 would also work). \n\n@stefan-kolb The idea to distinct between ID-based and text-based fetchers came from #383 and #550. Right now the interfaces only have one method but this might change in the future (for example, a method to check validity of a given ID would make sense for the ID-based fetcher). \nIf a fetcher is complex enough, then one of course still decompose the functionality in different classes. For the arXiv fetcher it felt like all the functionality is essentially given by one method (callApi) and the other methods are just different wrappers around it. \nDo you have a good idea how to handle for the help files in fetchers (logic) if HelpFiles stays in gui?\n =||= I still don't get why these two types of fetcher methods cannot live in one interface.\nMaybe this is more of a problem of our implementations than of the architecture abstraction?\nI haven't checked the usage of the HelpFiles yet, tho I think this has to be managed by the GUI somehow.\n =||= The helpfiles could be under the logic,, as they do not contain any gui related methods or any other related thing.\nThey just serve as a kind of Container class, they simply store the name of the HelpPage-Markdown file in an Enum.\nThe assembling of the url and opening is in the gui in HelpAction.\n =||= I think a two-stage search is preferred in many situations. All is not\nreally an option and sometimes one would really like to go for more than\n100 (which is a more reasonable number). Personally, I often use JabRef as\na search engine to find interesting papers (or rather, I search for a\nspecific paper and then find related ones so it makes sense to not have a\ntoo narrow query, also some publishers has a logic or on the search terms\nso you get more hits the more terms you add).\n\nJust try searching Springer or DOAJ for some common term, \"efficient\" or\n\"Smith\" or something.\n\nI think this can be solved though by adding another call so query -> number\nof hits -> number to fetch -> list of entries.\n =||= Thanks Oscar for bringing up this aspect. \n\nI think the main reason for introducing this step was to reduce the number of requests fired to the different providers as some of them are rather quick with blocking IPs crawling to much information in a short time.\nThus the number of matches to be shown is not only dependent on the intention of the user (find a single paper vs. search for all possible papers matching the search) but also might have technical reasons... \nHowever, personally I don't like the workflow \"Enter term\" > \"Start search\" > \"Determine number of hits and ask user how much hits should be displayed\" > \"List chosen number of hits\" \nI think \"Enter term\" > \"Start search\" >\"List first X hits\" + \"Label: Showing first X of Y hits\" + Button \"get next X hits\" would be better... but this would require some more methods in the Interfaces to start fetching from/to a given offset...\n =||= @simonharrer and @matthiasgeiger have persuaded me that I'm dumb, please merge as intended. Maybe the naming can be improved a little bit but this is NP-hard.\n =||= OK, so how should blocking be avoided?

Maybe use a event bus for the preferences as well, especially regarding the classes in the GUI package? This could maybe reduce the number of restarts that are required upon changing preferences. What do the other developers think? @JabRef/developers \n =||= It is a bit weird that the rows are not automatically resized on Windows. It seems like this happens for the heading but not the content rows. Maybe easier to send in a bug report to Oracle/Microsoft?\n =||= We are not the first who stumble across this issue. And I doubt that it will be fixed for Swing. \nFpr high dpi things, a  bit searching on SO found that source, which compares different sizes and dpi settings, including JavaFX:\nhttp://kynosarges.org/GuiDpiScaling.html\n =||= This isn't really the same thing as in the link, although it is somehow\nrelated as it tries to solve the same problem. Still, bad rendering when\nchanging the font size is a fundamental issue. (Or is there some automatic\nsize parameter that must be enabled?)\n\nI also doubt that they will fix it, though. Although it is probably quite\neasy as it works for the heading row, so just copy whatever different row\nheight calculation is there.\n =||= There is a better solution though (maybe better Googling before coding):\n\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/15568054/how-to-change-jtable-row-height-globally\n\nI'll try this out. Guess it is look-and-feel dependent but worth a try.\n =||= As there was recently a issue or forum discussion regarding this topic I just want to make sure that you are aware of two different configurations: There is the option to increase/decrease the table font size using the \"View\" menu and there is also the \"Menu and label font size\" in Preferences -> Appearance. The latter setting not only affects the \"Menu and label font size\" but also sets the font size in the entry editor and potentially at other places...\n\nAnd I just saw that there is also a \"Table row height padding\" setting which might be reason for the strange height behavior...?\n =||= The current behavior is affected by \"Menu and label font size\".\n\nAs far as I am concerned \"Table row height padding\" is only for the main entry table, as well as the explicit font setting and increase/decrease font size.\n\nIn the link there are arguments that this is a feature, so they will indeed not change it. (It appears as if the \"ideal\" default table row height is different on different OS to start with, so they decided to just use the same constant for all systems...)\n =||= Found a consistent way to do this. It also applied for JTree. I think that the \"global\" approach is Look-and-feel-dependent so this seems to be the best way to do it.\n =||= LGTM.

The feeling is that it is easier to merge the PR without moving of files first, but I'm not sure if that is true or if I just want less work. ;-)\n =||= By the way, there is a preference setting \"Enforce legal characters in BibTeX keys\".

I'm wondering if we upset many people by always enforcing legal characters?\n =||= @oscargus: My changes were quite small and would be relatively easy to redo, so it's ok for me if you go first.\n\nRegarding the BibTex keys: We have already upset at least one person in #1272. We talked about this issue on the devcall right now and arrived at the following decision:\n- The preference setting \"Enforce legal characters in BibTeX keys\" can be removed, hence we will only enforce `\"{}(),\\\\\\\"#~^'\"`.\n- Key validation should be based on the mode (BibTeX, BibLaTeX). Especially BibLaTeX is more strict and there should be an additional validation that checks for the symbols that are not allowed in BibLaTeX\n =||= OK! If anyone could have a look at the PR I'll merge it.\n\nSo basically, the (in the PR introduced) boolean argument to `checkLegalKey` should be replaced with isBibLatex?

I'm not sure if `getClass` is the universal solution here. Sure, it is faster than `instanceof` but the use is dependent on the class, see e.g. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4989818/instanceof-vs-getclass\n\nMight be good to get some consensus on this and add it to the code guidelines. \n\nThe other interesting question is if this should stop merging. Now I have updated it, but in this PR this was a very minor part and the alternative would have been to just not introduce the null check in the first place. The question is really if that would have been a better alternative? It is another thing if issues are introduced by incomplete code. To me it is not a problem, but I am thinking how new contributors react. There is a risk that they won't fix these minor issues if they are part of a bigger one or that they will stop contributing.\n =||= Regarding equals consensus is easy. Effective Java sets the standard here. Let me quote the rules for implementing equals (for a deeper explanation, please refer to the book):\n1. Use the `==` operator to check if the argument is a reference to this object. If so, return true.\n2. Use the `instanceof` operator to check if the argument has the correct type. f not, return false.\n3. Cast the argument to the correct type.\n4. For each \u201csignificant\u201d field in the class, check if that field of the argument matches the corresponding field of this object. If all these tests succeed, return true otherwise, return false.\n5. When  you  are  finished writing your equals method, ask yourself three questions: Is it symmetric? Is it transitive? Is it consistent?\n\nAlso, note:\n- Always override `hashCode` when you override `equals` (hashCode also has very strict rules)\n- Don\u2019t try to be too clever\n- Don\u2019t substitute another type for Object in the equals declaration\n\nRegarding JabRef, most equals methods are probably broken in one way or the other. We should gradually replace these with correct implementations. From my point of view, incorrect equals methods should prohibit the merging of a PR. It is not so hard to implement a correct one (since most IDEs generate it), so it something that we can ask from people in my point of view. If you do it, it should be correct. As a side note, your implementation does not fully follow the rules, the first null check is not necessary as it is included in the third check (`null instanceof SomeClass` will always return false). This is just a performance issue, though, not a correctness one. However, you still need to provide a proper implementation of `hashCode`, otherwise the classes will fail to work when used in a `HashMap`. I'd suggest you let your IDE generate an implementation.\n =||= My point was rather going from a broken `equals` to a slightly less broken `equals` (which is what happened here) rather than introducing a broken `equals`. Was the alternative of not touching the `equals` at all better? Simpler for sure.\n\nI agree with you and, apart from the `this == oher` check is more or less how I usually write mine (no explicit checking for null).\n\nEclipse seems not to be one of those IDEs though. Or I haven't found the switch to make it more clever than `super(other)`...\n =||= You would have gotten away without touching equals ;-) My point is: If you touch it, you should go all the way.\n\nEclipse generates you these methods via the menu: Source-> \"Generate hashCode() and equals()\". Your cursor needs to be in the class in which you want to generate the methods. In the following dialog, you can select the significant attributes of the class.\n =||= Yes, that's my point. My question is if that is better? ;-)\n\nAhh, OK! Thanks! The generation based on warnings seems to be different.\n =||= I added your bullets in the Wiki.\n =||= Great! So this PR is now good to go, right? (at least from my point of view)\n =||= Be warned about the Eclipse generated equals methods, it is not always ideal/correct.\nusing instanceOf makes sense if you want subtypes to be equal. But that is a philsophocial questions...;)\nAnd for HashCode there is the nice Object.hash() method.\n =||= I merge this now.

I think the current implementation is \"wrong\" with respect to the information provided in the link as JabRef only accepts `@comment { .... }` as valid comments... right? @lenhard \n =||= The tricky/interesting thing here is probably that by writing @Comment instead of an entry type, the next lines are also treated as comments (as they do not start with @ or are inside a non-Comment entry type). So it is quite important to keep those comment lines. :-)\n =||= I tried to find some more information on this topic, but I can't find any more details, if it used as block or not.\nEven in the original BibTeX manual it is just written that `@Comment` is allowed for compatibility reasons of _Scribe_  \n =||= I had a quick look at the parser. \n\n@matthiasgeiger: Currently, we accept `@comment`, but the casing does not matter (`@cOmMeNt` should also work with the current implementation).\n\n@oscargus: The error occurs, because the parser expects something that starts with `@` to be eventually followed by `{`. If it doesn't find an opening curly bracket, it throws this error. That is really independent of comments or entry types.\n\nIf I get this issue right we should be able to parse comments that are not followed by curly braces? I would really love some more **official** documentation on bibtex syntax (really an real official information you find would be very welcome), but I guess the best we have is a compiler. \n\nLast but not least: Note that the current implementation drops any user comments from the database, i.e., anything within `@comment` that does not have a meta data flag or a custom entry type. A way to avoid this is to not use `@comment`, but just any text without `@`, which, in the current implementation should be kept.\n =||= @lenhard  the official BibTex source can be found here: https://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/biblio/bibtex/base\nHowever, there is no gold-standard, but most parsers I gave a quick look accept at least `@Comment{}`\n =||= @Siedlerchr yes, unfortunately it is a bit scarce on comments.\n\nSo far I do not see a consensus here. Is there something that we should change about the parser? @JabRef/developers what do you say? If yes, what exactly is it and how would the desired behavior look like?\n =||= As far as I know `@Comment` is a value-only entry type, exactly like `@Preamble`. Thus it expects an argument (which might be empty) between braces. \nSince there is no defined bibtex standard, I would propose to use the [official biblatex parser](https://github.com/ambs/Text-BibTeX) as an authoritative source. I don't have the time to check the code carefully, but https://github.com/ambs/Text-BibTeX/blob/5ec5ec913122f0d17246e8fa5c764eef6645944f/btparse/tests/data/comment.bib suggests that at least some form of parentheses should be used. \n\nWhat we should do is to display a more informative error message.\n =||= I read up a bit and it seems like @Comment in the (authoritative) BibTeX application works in two ways:\n- If it is followed by a brace, everything is commented out until the next matching brace (with \"brace\" being at least {}, \"\", and, based on Tobias link, ()). See a footnote in Tame the BeaST for this, where it is stated that the only practical use for it is to comment out large parts of a bib-file since it is enough to just remove the @ for a single entry.\n- If it is not followed by a brace, the rest of the line is the comment (and as a consequence, following lines may also be comments...). My colleagues file have been working for years before I loaded it in JabRef. Some internet documentation supports this, so people may use it.\n =||= Have a look at #1638\n\nComments marked by `@Comment` are now supported, regardless of whether they use brackets or not. I have added automated tests for this and tested it manually, but @oscargus please verify with the bib file of your colleague.\n\nEssentially, it took a mere five lines of code (one try catch block) and a change in one method call to implement this. The fact that so few changes are needed shows that we are finally making progress in the extensibility of JabRef. All the quality refactoring finally starts to pay of. I'm happy right now :-)\n =||= @lenhard Loads well! Some (expected) info from the logger, but nothing else.

Didn't think of using \"\", but clearly that is a good (enough) approach!\n =||= Although this is closed I post here as a user report as I think my experience is related to the \u201cuncertain\u201d search nomenclature that is required.  Also related is issue #1505 regarding the apparent heterogeneous regex-regular expression implementation. IMHO being able to search reliably IS ESSENTIAL and of high priority for large database situation.\nI was attempting to do a general search with a specific exclusion (word1 and not word2) and conclude that at best the current help files http://help.jabref.org/en/SearchHelp and http://jabref.sourceforge.net/help/SearchHelp.php for `Search` are misleading and incomplete. The poor search behaviour has been present within JabRef and the recent changes have unfortunately not corrected these issues it seems.\n\nHover-over the search entry shows the full logic in words. This is a great feature, but doesn't seem to reflect what the help file suggest is should, not what Search seems to do.\n\n\"\"word1 and not word2\"\"  selects all entries and highlights all those words including 'and' and 'not'.\n\"\"word1 not word2\"\" selects all entries and highlights all those words including 'not'.\n\nIf I enter \"word1 and not field2=word2\"\"  eg: \"flow and not memo=PhD\" search totally fails with hover-over showing \"... flowand and  not and memo=PhD\"  It appears to not recognise the and, instead ignoring the space and adding it to the word, then inserting extra ands!\n\nI concluded the algorithm has be rewritten to look for `Field2=word1...Field2=word2...` but how do you specify to search all fields for one word? From the helpfile the following should work\n title|keywords = \"image processing\" \n title--keywords = \"image processing\"  but neither works.\n eg: (author = miller or title|keywords = \"image processing\") and not author = brown cut and paste from the help file does work (neither with a hyphen or a double hypen).\n\nInterestingly `Search` automatically decides content in a non-regex entry is regex, but it doesn't seem to work.\nA very useful trick to solve my composite entry requiring a search on all fields would be .\\* =flow . The hover-over pop-up states that \"any entries in which the field matching .\\* contains the word flow.\" however it does not do this in practice. \n\nentrytype=Phdthesis where = means contains works\nentrytype!=PhD where != means does not contain works\nentrytype==Phdthesis  where == means is exactly works\n\"word1 word2 word 3\" where \"\" indicate a string works\n\nBracketing doesn't work at all as I expect from the help files with spaces before and after words changing the hover-over displayed meaning.\n\nI expect the problems identified are the different logic and regexpertise level of the programmers exacerbated by the limited help available. If so could this flag an upgrade of the help file with more extensive examples of multipart searches.\n =||= An update to my previous post that is part of my confion and I think is a BUG.\n\nWhen searching for an expression it can be enclosed in `\"expression words\"` however the closing \" removes the _s_ so it finds  _expression word_ !  I doubt debugging would pick this up becasue it will find the target _expression words_  It will also annoyingly pick up _expression wordsmith_ and _badexpression word_ . To avoid these you have to insert a space before and two after to get the expected result (ie: `\" expression words  \"` two trailing spaces! )\n\nOnce you figure the crytic entry requirement it isn't a problem until you attempt to find something like LES. The issue is that LES also appears in words such as bubbles and coalescence. To avoid these you can use the _spaces_ trick, however this then does not pick up first word field entry starting with LES. If all LES entries were capitals that would be the solution, but they are not always :-(\n\nWhat I really wanted was a way to specify keyword \"LES\" meaning just _LES_ not _ILES_ or _LES boundary conditions._  so using spaces to isolate a keyword is imperfect cludge.\n\nI have still to find how to search `allfields=xyz and keywords!=\"just-LES\"` as there is not an `allfields` search option. The outcome is that capturing all entries while cutting out garbage hits is time consuming on a large database.\n =||= @ajbelle The issue of the last character disappearing was reported in #1643 and is claimed to be fixed in https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/commit/2c9c7ddfea4cb28defe9831cf0df388555f3ca9b (with tests showing that it probably is). Have you tried version 3.6?\n\nThe `allfields` approach should be quite feasible to implement, although somehow it would be even better if not specifying a field leads to that behaviour (that I do not know how to do though). \n\nAlthough it is not solving what you are actually asking (searching the keywords field on a keyword by keyword basis rather than the complete field), I just want to point out the possibility to write something like `not entrytype==book` which would match e.g. `inbook` and `booklet` as opposed to `entrytype!=book`.\n\nFrom a code perspective adding special handling of the keywords field should be quite feasible, but I do not know how it will hurt performance. Would it make sense to introduce a pseudo-field `keyword` for searching on a keyword by keyword basis or is it just confusing as it is so close to keywords?\n\nI may have time to look at this in the near future, although the person with the best knowledge of the search system is having a break to finish his dissertation.\n\nWe should probably have a look at the documentation as well, especially if these new things are introduced.\n =||= @ajbelle Turned out that I just as well could add those lines right now. Please try it out at https://builds.jabref.org/bettersearch in a few minutes. Both `allfields` and `keyword` are added.\n\nHowever, when trying it I realized that `not keyword==LES` would find entries which has at least one keyword that isn't `LES` rather than not containing any keyword that is `LES`. I wonder if I should add yet another pseudo-field `anykeyword`? What do you think?\n =||= Sorry, I was wrong about the discussion above regarding `anykeyword`.\n =||= @ajbelle If you try out the very latest version I renamed these fields to `anyfield` and `anykeyword` as it gets a bit more fluent when you read the query.\n\n`anyfield contains fruit and anykeyword matches banana`\n =||= Thank you @oscargus your solution is brilliant.

I know, we should use some cool data structures.

The question is just what the logic should be? Say that a column shows \"author/doi\", \"author\" is a mandatory field, but only the \"doi\" is present. Color?\n =||= Is it possible to enable \"Color codes for resolved fields\" as soon as one changes the color for resolved fields?\n\nColor: If (at least) one mandatory field is missing: Color it red. Otherwise, normal color. In your example, the field would be red: Some content is there, but not the mandatory one.\n =||= Currently, only the number is colored red, so I do not think that is actually the answer. There may, for example, be another column with \"editor\" which is present and the entry is a book. I know it sounds complicated (and made up examples), but I thought about it and I do not really see what logic should be used for marking required and optional fields when there are multiple fields in one column.\n\nMaybe the easiest way is to just enable the resolved entry marking by default?

Votes are not the only metric that we use to determine the requests that are implemented, however, they do factor into our decision-making process.\n- If all information is provided and still up-to-date, then just add a short comment that the issue is still relevant.\n\nThank you for your contribution! =||= "], ["1647", "RIS import", null, "asnobli", "09/28/16, 09:14:38 AM", "1. doi import does not work with the DO or M3 (RIS standard fields)\n2. patent is imported as \"other\"", "Thanks for reporting.

Apparently it is part of Bibtex, and, therefore, we parse it, have an editor for it and serialize it. It seems that it is more relevant for programs that compile the bib file. Here are some, not very conclusive references on the preamble: [first](http://maverick.inria.fr/~Xavier.Decoret/resources/xdkbibtex/bibtex_summary.html#preamble), [second](http://www.bibtex.org/Format/), [third](https://www.cs.arizona.edu/~collberg/Teaching/07.231/BibTeX/bibtex.html). \n\nIf you want to decide, which strings are used in a preamble, it would be best to parse the preamble string and look for occurrences of `#`.

Then, the GUI tests will work on Travis again.\n\nI will also update the Eclipse settings that it won't join lines. I think, the current code formatting is good enough and we should get rid of `@formatter:off` tags.\n\nWhat do you mean by \"stable\" tests? Are the effects always different?\n\nThe thing is, we decided to go away from GUI tests, because they always cause trouble and headaches. Our UI code is sometimes a really mess and thus the GUI tests will probably never be stable. We have to switch to JavaFX completely to have a clean and testable GUI code.\n =||= \"Stable\" in the sense that they pass on Travis every time, independent of which other tests are running (and to some extent even locally...).\n\nAlthough I do not think it makes sense to run all these tests for every PR/build due to the time it takes, they may still be useful to run before a release, including adding more of these simple \"just click everything you can and see that nothing bad happens\". Both #1710 and #1714 were consequences of these tests and with some slightly more advanced ones, the bugs solved in #1631 and #1649 would never have made it (since they happened simply by clicking on \"open file\"). So somehow it would, eventually, be good to merge them so that they are available, but at some new location that are not automatically executed at every build. And when it comes to gradle etc I'm lost.\n =||= We have CircleCI for a quick build checking for compilation issues and if JabRef compiles, the binaries are served at builds.jabref.org. Then, it doesn't matter, how long TravisCI runs. All tests should run at each PR so that the author is directly notified about unwanted side effects of his PR. When we run the tests at a release only, it is a much higher effort to track down the cause and we will probably not run the tests at all to safe time during release.\n =||= I see the point and I agree that ideally it should be like that, but now the new GUI tests have already started to fail... Still, it makes sense to run these (massive and trivial) tests every now and then just to see that nothing, very unexpected, has happened.\n\nSomehow I see two options: remove them, because they are unstable, or keep them but only run them on occasion. The third option doesn't seem like it can be actually selected at the moment...\n =||= Now, on TravisCI, integration tests still run, but are not treated as breaking the build - 7832ddf72cd0c08b965d5e985544658ca2e9416a\n\nThat means, one can run the tests on occasion and if one wants to dive deeper, he can try to solve the issues. Howver, we think, the GUI code might be that broken so that we have to focus on porting JabRef completely to JavaFX. We track the progress at https://github.com/koppor/jabref/issues/143. \"Broken\" means that some GUI code runs outside the [EDT](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/concurrency/dispatch.html).\n =||= "], ["1701", "French localization: Jabref_fr: empty strings translated", "MLEP", "mlep", "08/09/16, 07:01:59 AM", "<!-- describe the changes you have made here: what, why, ... -->\n- [ ] Change in CHANGELOG.md described\n- [ ] Tests created for changes\n- [ ] Screenshots added (for bigger UI changes)\n- [ ] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef", "NaN"], ["1702", "French localization: Menu: Translation of an empty string", "MLEP", "mlep", "08/09/16, 07:01:45 AM", "<!-- describe the changes you have made here: what, why, ... -->\n- [ ] Change in CHANGELOG.md described\n- [ ] Tests created for changes\n- [ ] Screenshots added (for bigger UI changes)\n- [ ] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef", "NaN"], ["1703", "Improve shared database feature", "Oliver Kopp", "koppor", "09/22/16, 08:49:46 PM", "Follow up of #1451\n- [x] Database properties dialog:\n  - [x] Do not show \"Save sort order\" - database sorts arbitrarily :innocent: \n  - [x] Do not show \"Database protection\" - makes no sense in a shared database setting\n- [x] Session restore: JabRef should open all `[shared]` tabs after startup\n- [x] Store last used connection in the \"open remote database dialog\"\n- [x] \"open remote database dialog\": \"Connect\" button should be disabled an label change to \"Connecting...\".

The loader is essential for the formatter to work and thus should be injected as a dependency through the constructor.\n- Remove ProtectTermsFormatter from CleanupPreset. Protected terms should be handled similar to JournalAbbreviations by inserting the `ProtectedTermsLoader` into the constructor of the `CleanupWorker`. Reason: the `ProtectedTermsLoader` does not influence _which_ cleanup operations should be invoked (CleanupPreset) but _how_ these operations are executed (CleanupWorker).", "OK, then you can tell me how to do that considering the static initializer in https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/master/src/main/java/net/sf/jabref/logic/formatter/Formatters.java\n\nThe second part is not a problem (if the first one works).\n =||= I'm sure you mean something else with CleanupPreset than https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/master/src/main/java/net/sf/jabref/logic/cleanup/CleanupPreset.java but I cannot figure out what right now. \n\nAnd I cannot really say that I still think the injection of JournalAbbreviationLoader in lots and lots of methods and classes is a good idea as such. For CleanupWorker it is injected in case someone would like to create a filename pattern using the journal abbreviation layout formatter. Removing support for that formatter will remove 80% of all the uses...\n\nAs long as we do not want to deal with that formatter explicitly in the code, I do not actually see how the second part should be done. So, again, please inform me (or solve it, I just removed a bug that practically rendered the Manage content selectors dialog useless for almost four months, which I correctly could have assigned you).\n =||= Regarding your questions:\n- Simply don't use static fields. `List<Formatter> getConverters(arguments required to initialized them)` and similar for the other types. Static fields work great for static thinks, but the formatters can depend on the state (preferences) and thus are not static.\n- I can't find the code I was thinking about. Can you please point me to the location where the ProtectTermsFormatter is initialized from SaveActions or when one runs a cleanup action? \n  I think I didn't liked that https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/f0183627f6d930dc168e4476d3a34d28f31f7a84/src/test/java/net/sf/jabref/logic/cleanup/CleanupWorkerTest.java#L291 initialized the formatter (i.e. the preset) with the loader and not the cleanup worker. Fixing this would require that one introduces a new enum containing all formatters and often work with this enum instead of with the actual formatter class.

My .bib file of 49.34MB has 29,933 entries. However on my  Dell Latitude dual core laptop running 32bit win7 and Java Ver8.91. editing this file has not been possible since Ver3!\n\nJabRef does display the pop-up that some entries still have no bibtexkey, but it gets no futher. The JabRef.exe Memory usage is just over 300MB, with the duo-core laptop sitting at 30% plus usage (meaning the executable is accessing two CPU.  \n\nThe exception is Ver3.0 loads slowly at less than 300MB but any action such as open entry, scroll entries edit and save take CPU and memory usage to the 300+MB 30+% usage and lock up JabRef for several minutes until the next input is possible. It is not disk bound and the the total RAM used on the system is 1.2G out of 3G so it seems to be a max out on a single CPU which goes to 100% frequency and full load each lock up. Thus I conclude it is not faulty code per se, but code which is pushing the hardware beyond its limits, where this hardware is not efficiently interfacing between the two threads.\n\nRolling back to Ver 2.9.2 returns performance to that comparable with my 64bit  desk top PC. The only significant performance monitor difference of Ver2 is that the CPU usage peaks at 25% suggesting JabRef does not attempt to use more than one CPU. The RAM usage is higher at 356MB. This is reason I believe it is JabRef related as all versions previous to V3 worked fine on this hardware, and no other known changes have been made to the laptop.\n\nMy conclusion is to increase speed Ver3 uses multiple threads which when implemented in the 32 bit versions is locking up my laptop.Would a non-multithreading preference setting for low spec PC would solve this issue?\n\nPS: The latest version all work great and fast on the Laptop with TRIVIAL .bib files as one would generate for a single paper.

Could it be that the issue was introduced in one of these versions?\n\nWe internally collect bib files of others for testing. I can't find one of yours. Would you mind sharing it with us? You can send it via email to me personally.\n =||= THX @koppor. You may be right because returning to my desktop PC I found that I had corrupted files (a small example of which I attach).  If you search with a text editor on the last entry JabRef loads you will find the following entry is incomplete and is then followed by a complete version!!! This has been done by JabRef_windows-x64_3_6dev--snapshot--2016-08-10--master--4db7557.exe which I installed to regain access to GOOGLE Search on my desktop box. @#*&%^& took out my main file which I am now reconstructing :-( \n\nThis is the second time I have found an older version 2.9.2 has been able to fix something Ver3 no longer seems to be able to. Somehow JabRef_windows-x64_3_6dev--snapshot--2016-08-10--master--4db7557.exe makes a 'half corrupt version' which I managed to re-opened with 2.9.2 and save to reduce lost work.  JabRef_windows-x64_3_6dev--snapshot--2016-08-10--master--4db7557.exe can open it, but saves it in a more corrupt state that not even it can open. None of the Ver3 releases can open the any mashed files, but Ver 2.9.2 could.  Robustness is more important than speed to me.\n\nSorry it is still confusing to me. Will retest Ver3+ on the laptop with a non-corrupt file and update tomorrow. I have not put in an issue on the development release file corruption.\n\n[CorruptExample.zip](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/files/412625/CorruptExample.zip)\n =||= A hint here is that the incomplete entry ends just before the @ in the email address. No idea what that means, but my give a hint to those more knowledgeable in the parser/writer.\n\nDid the previous version of you bibfile by any chance have quotation marks around that field?\n =||= Okay I can reproduce the behavior that breaks your file @ajbelle \n\nIssue is tracked at #1716 as this is unrelated from the performance issue you originally reported here.\n =||= @matthiasgeiger THX and yes. I checked again last night with uncorrupted files and the behaviour reported in my first post still occurs on the 32bit Win7 duo-core (4 CPU) laptop. \n\n@oscargus no changes to the .bib file, but matthias already identified the issue, which makes sense to me.\n\nOnly V3.0 gets the large .bib file open (I tried a slightly smaller version with the same results), but then any interaction immediately locks the processor to 25% or more for 30+ seconds as if it is processing the whole file for every user input.  My question would be is \"what is ver3 doing for each user input that requires extensive CPU power that earlier versions did not?\" Ver 2.9.2 gets it open in 'normal' time and has no delay on trivial user inputs like opening a different entry.\nThat is all I can contribute as have deadlines for the next six month or fail PhD :-(  JabRef is very important to me.\n\nPS: I notice when I use mulitple cores on my I7 win7 desktop to do a six CPU CFD run the speed performance of  post ver3  JabRef takes a hit, hinting at the behaviour witnessed on the laptop, suggesting the increased CPU requirement is universal. This did not happen pre Ver3.\n =||= @ajbelle Good look with our PhD! It would be really nice if you tested JabRef 2.10 and 2.11.1 available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/jabref/files/jabref/. This would help us to track down the root cause of the high CPU load.\n =||= @koppor THX Oliver. I installed  2.10 and 2.11.1 on the 32bit Win7 laptop and tested as you asked. The results were the same as Ver  2.9.2. with slight difference in timing of when things finally showed up, but operation was fine. I hope this helps. \n\nOn my main I7 machine I have noticed that with each release the amount of stuff JabRef seems to do automatically with each operation increases (Within groups it seems to re-sort on the fly, with entries moving and jumping about for a few seconds before you can do the next step). There seems to be more lag in general. This is not noticable with small .bib files like I imagine programmers test with.\n\nAs an aside, due to JabRef UI logic, I grabbed the whole 30000 entries with \"select All\" that I thought applied to just a group and pasted to an equivalent file!!!! It took my Jabref 3.5  I7 Win7 Desktop PC to 100% CPU usage for hours before it finished (it didn't display the \"Resolve duplicates\"  screen it should have). I was impressed JabRef managed it at all. I  have never seen JabRef consume more than two CPU :-)  \n =||= Update: I migrated V3.5 to my home desktop PC is 64Bit Intel I7  Win7 home edition and the news is not quite as bad as the 32Bit lap-top but after creating a few more groups in the database this PC too started the very delayed response to user input. The only difference I can see from my Uni PC is that I only have 4GB of RAM, instead of 32GB. Checking usages indicates that it is operating within memory limits without excessive disk access.\n\nMy uninformed impression is that in order to gain speed JabRef pre-processes things like Groups every update cycle, but when you have a large .bib file and multiple groups this massively increases the memory/CPU load, locking JabRef until it is complete.  If @koppor 's large .bib file doesn't exhibit this issue, it may be it has no groups. I set up 11 groups and after each new one JabRef seemed to exhibit more lag.  Also, about half my entries have an Abstract or Review which effectively may cause greater load (eg: the 30k entries at 44.6Mb reduced to 20.3Mb file after removing them, and I wonder if these could be relegated to a secondary file having only the Bibtexkey, Abstract or Review as I only need them when looking in depth at a paper!? For global searching it pulls up too many false positives ).\n\nI conclude the locking is not a \"bug\", but how JabRef uses up Windows resources when presented with my .bib file. Thus it is a question of whether a warning about size limits on lesser specification PCs is required, or if better programming can provide an option to select manual update instead of a complete refresh for every user input cycle.\n =||= @ajbelle You are probably correct in that we do not have that big databases with many groups. However, it is clearly in our interest to get hold of one of those, so if you could send it to @koppor (email in this profile) it would really be helpful (or maybe you already have).\n\nAlthough we have generated \"large\" artificial databases and improved performance quite a bit based on those in some areas, they clearly didn't cover all the relevant aspects (as obvious from your performance problems).\n\nMy guess is that the review and abstract is not really causing the performance problem as, while they consume quite a bit of memory as you indicates, not that many operations are really done for them. Instead I would expect that some of the code monitoring e.g. added entries may be triggered in an inefficient way when loading such a big database and that the updates of dynamic groups maybe can be more efficiently triggered. However, these are parts where I personally have limited insight.\n =||= Thank you @oscargus. \n\n**I confirm that it is the Groups that is killing JabRef.** The attached files (contains just the groups I set up) which even my 32MB RAM university PC started to show UI lags! I have had to remove the groups making JabRef not nice for the purpose I hoped and significantly increases the manual work I have to do. \n\nThe reason I have not sent my database is that it 'part belongs to a research group' and I don't have authority to share it with Oliver @koppor. I will look if I can somehow provide a version that avoids this problem in confidentially. It is full of garbage that trips up JabRef due to its import from Endnote, pulling direct from the internet and PDFs, plus my own special fields and formats ;-) JabRef crashes on me a least twice per day!\n\nYour improved search provision  `anyfield` and `anykeyword` per issue #1633 may reduce the expression complexity and hopefully CPU load of the searches.\n\n**a setting to disable auto-Group update** (and maybe other background auto-updates in response to UI) for larger files is a good solution (if the update code is in a single module). Even with my cut down 32Mb 22k entry file JabRef it exhibits bad delays. Power-users would be happy to manually update changes to avoid the unworkable lag IMHO.\n\n[AJB_Groups.bib.txt](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/files/454547/AJB_Groups.bib.txt)\n =||= @ajbelle: Is this problem still present in the current 3.7?

By adding a 'new entry' identifier to the read in parser the error location could also be more closely specified.

report](https://gist.github.com/cr333/4e0d715d96fb2004ed26e7cdbc2f7686) for details.\n\nI observe the same behaviour in JabRef 3.5 and the lastest development version (3.6dev--snapshot--2016-08-12--master--ad6b5cc). I also deleted JabRef, emptied the trash, rebooted and installed JabRef, with the same outcome.\n\nPreviously, I used JabRef 2.11 (I think), but deleted that before installing the newest version.", "@chochreiner Could you have a look?\n\n@cr333 Could you check older releases (e.g., 3.0) in case you have some time? - We just want to get an idea of the issue.\n =||= I only have 10.11.6 (15G31) running on my mac and I I cannot reproduce the issue\nyou may try to delete the following file: \n~/Library/Preferences/net.sf.jabref.plist\n =||= I deleted ~/Library/Preferences/net.sf.jabref.plist but still got the same crash with 3.6-dev.\n\nJabRef 3.0 throws a NullPointerException during installation ([see log file](https://gist.github.com/cr333/3c558565567eb5ca443d6108371315c2)), but installation finishes and JabRef starts up and appears to work fine. Same for 3.2.\n\nJabRef 3.3 installs without problems, but then crashes in the same way as the recent versions. It looks like something between 3.2 and 3.3 introduced this problem.\n =||= Can you please check whether the same problem occurs if you use the .jar Version (runnable with out installation)\n\nThanks! \n =||= I tried all versions between 3.0 to 3.5, and none of the .jars opened. This was with Java version \"1.6.0_65\", which I believe is [Apple\u2019s Legacy Java 6 runtime](https://support.apple.com/kb/dl1572).\n\nThen I installed the latest JRE from java.com (Version 8 Update 101), and all of the .jars now open correctly.\n\nHowever, when I use the JabRef installers for OS X, I see the same crashes as before. The only difference I see now is that the installer doesn't download the JRE anymore before the first step, like it used to do before.\n =||= Can you please post the output of: \n\n/usr/libexec/java_home -verbose\n\nand can you check, if the installation of the current JDK [1] fixes the issue\n\n[1] http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html\n =||= Thanks for the suggestions. This is what I get:\n\n```\n$ /usr/libexec/java_home -verbose\nMatching Java Virtual Machines (2):\n    1.6.0_65-b14-466.1, x86_64: \"Java SE 6\" /System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk/Contents/Home\n    1.6.0_65-b14-466.1, i386:   \"Java SE 6\" /System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk/Contents/Home\n\n/System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk/Contents/Home\n```\n\nInstalling the JDK didn't fix the issue. JavaApplicationStub still crashes in 3.5 as before (I didn't test all versions).\n =||= @cr333  JabRef3.x needs Java 8. So I think the problem is that the java6 is still registered as the main java environment.  Mabye you could try uninstalling that first and then test again with the installer/java8?\n =||= (Resolution at the bottom.)\n\nSo I removed all Java from my machine, including [Apple\u2019s Java 6](http://superuser.com/a/712783/403176), [Oracle\u2019s JRE 8](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/mac_uninstall_java.xml) and [JDK 8](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/mac_jdk.html), and restarted my computer.\n\nInstalling JabRef 3.5 downloads the JRE, but when started, it still crashes in JavaApplicationStub as before. Opening `JabRef-3.5.jar` fails as no Java is installed.\n\nI install Oracle\u2019s JRE 8 (same version as above). Installing JabRef 3.5 from scratch skips downloading the JRE, but later crashes in the same way. Opening `JabRef-3.5.jar` works fine.\n\nI uninstall Oracle\u2019s JRE 8 and install JDK 8 instead, but no difference (i.e. installing JabRef 3.5 from scratch skips downloading the JRE, but later crashes in the same way; opening `JabRef-3.5.jar` works fine).\n\nAfter some digging, I found that [IntelliJ IDEA suffered a similar issue](https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/articles/208516145) and it is caused by a bug related to custom keyboard layouts (of which I use one). They suggest the following fixes:\n1. update to OSX 10.11 which fixes the problem\n2. install Java 1.6 (it will not be used to run IDE, but is known to fix the bug)\n3. disable custom keyboard layout in the keyboard preferences (if you have any in ~/Library/Keyboard Layouts).\n4. Update to a new test build [not sure how they fixed this issue in the end]\n\nI installed the latest [Apple Java 6](https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572) and now everything works as expected, i.e. the installer for JabRef 3.5 downloads the JRE if no suitable JRE is found, and JabRef 3.5 starts and works as it should.\n\nFrom my point of view, this issue is now resolved. However, I'm not sure how this issue could be fixed in JabRef or if it is indeed worth fixing at all given how niche the issue is and that there are known workarounds. Thanks again for trying to figure this out with me.\n =||= Thanks for your reply! And good to hear that your problem has been fixed!\n\nI'll rename your bug report to indicate that custom keyboard layouts are causing this trouble and will close it afterwards.\n =||= "], ["1724", "ConcurrentModificationException when removing a field in the source editor", "Oscar Gustafsson", "oscargus", "08/14/16, 10:30:21 PM", "JabRef version latest dev on both CentOS and Windows 10\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1.

Regarding the language field, there is already code for translating the lang field to LCID, but it may be not functioning correctly.\n =||= @Mattri  Regarding the language mapping, I looked a bit deeper and think that we can not provide a complete mapping for all kind of languages, because the LCID Language codes are not easy translatable into the internally java used.

Could they be made available?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nStephen. =||= @spalc  Hi,  I just created a fix which adds the field for export and import.\r\nYou can test this one here, or wait until #1851 is merged into the master and then use the latest snapshot\r\nhttps://builds.jabref.org/office007translator/ \r\n\r\n> Is there still work being done on MS Office 2007 xml import/export\r\nLike any other feature: If you encounter a problem, bug or have an enhancement, just open an issue.\r\nIn this case, adding the field was one simple line of code.\r\nUnfortunately, the MS Office Exporter and Importer is a bit more complicated, therefore there is not a way to use the layout files for this, especially the conversion of authors and dates into their corresponding fields it not trivial.\r\n\r\nFor your reference, you can find a complete overview of the field mapping between biblatex and msoffice xml here in the help:\r\nhttps://help.jabref.org/en/MsOfficeBibFieldMapping\r\n =||= Hi Christoph,\r\nMany thanks for your action and reply. I will test the fix for TRANSLATOR.\r\nI have just started to try out Jabref and I like the interface.\r\n\r\nI took a look at the field mapping between biblatex and ms office xml and ran a few tests.\r\nRegarding the treatment of the Jabref address field, I note that when an address like \"New York\" is used on its own as city  the xml export module treats \"New\" as city and \"York\" as StateProvince.  If there is no comma separating the elements of the address field it would be better if the address field, even if it contains several words, is treated as \"only city\".  If the contents are separated by commas then the address field should be broken down into distinct xml Word fields (City, StateProvince, CountryRegion).\r\n\r\nI will continue to explore the tool and let you know if I have other suggestions.\r\nStephen.\r\n =||= Hi,\r\nthanks for the feedback!\r\nRegarding the address field and other potential improvements, it would ne nice if you could just open new specific issue to make it easier to track the features/bugs and the code fixes =||= I just accidentally pushed directly to the master \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f. so the address fix and the translator fix are now both in the latest master. https://builds.jabref.org/master/ =||= Thanks Christoph.\r\nI installed 4.2 and tested translator and address.

Please try to save database repeatedly, because the bug is not always reproducible.. [{a is the only entry in title field.

Then during the actual save, the next dialog shows.\n\nWhen pressing the toolbar button, the save action starts despite the first dialog not being confirmed. Then, after a while, a second dialog shows up and then it freeze. It seems related to the spin library somehow. Looking at BasePanel.runCommand() it is the following line that freezes the program:\n\n``` java\n                wrk.run(); // Runs the potentially time-consuming action\n                // without freezing the GUI. The magic is that THIS line\n                // of execution will not continue until run() is finished.\n```\n\nprobably because both dialogs are up at the same time (the first one cannot be clicked during debug).\n =||= OK, I think I know what the problem is, but I do not really know how to solve it.\n- Ctrl-s => trigger `SaveDatabaseAction` in `EntryEditor` which runs `updateField` that trigger the first dialog, waits for it to press OK and then invokes the actual save action using `BasePanel.runCommand()` that invokes `exporter` `SaveDatabaseAction` which blocks the ui in the end of `init` in the three-step init-run-update process and unblocks it at the end of `update`. During the `run` another call to `updateField` is done which trigger the second dialog (the same code as in `updateField` at least). As `run` is done outside of the EDT, the EDT can take care of the dialog.\n- Save menu => Only the call to `BasePanel.runCommand()`\n- Toolbar button => as for save menu, but there is also a FocusLost event triggered which leads to the first dialog. Once the dialog is shown (no need to click it), the EDT continue running the save action, blocking the input and showing the next dialog, which is when things freezes as the EDT is busy waiting for the first dialog (or something)...\n\nAny ideas how to solve it?\n =||= AFAIK it's recommended to use for this cases methods or statements that are `synchronized`.\n =||= Fixed in #1863.\n =||= For Ctrl-S and File > Save database the invalidBackgroundColor (red) is only flashing up for a short period of time. This is, because the FieldEditorFocusListener sets the ValidBackgroundColor (white) on focusLost. I think this is not necessary, because the EntryEditor sets the ValidBackgroundColor already. Should I fix that?\n =||= If you think you have a solution it would be excellent! Please also see #1866 in case they are related somehow. I guess we really need to figure out some good logic for these things (how FocusLost, Save, selecting a new entry etc interact), but since I do not really see a \"total rewrite\" solution anything that improves it is welcome.\n\nBtw, I learned today that if the JabRefFrame is used as parent for JOptionPane it becomes modal, so everything (most?) else is stopped and waits.

Thus it works if a user is using ISO-8859-1 as default encoding but not in all other cases...\n\nThe question is how solve this... we can either switch the user-agent to a \"Mozilla-like-String\" to get UTF-8 data from Google _AND_ hard-code `downloadToString(StandardCharsets.UTF_8)` or we use \"JabRef\" and use the ISO charset (both variant also solve #1694)\n\nOpinions?\n =||= Hm.

The text field sets the variable `FILE_DIRECTORY`. This directory is used by \"Move file to file directory\" in Entry editor > File. This is useful. The checkbox below toggles between `WORKING_DIRECTORY` and `FILE_DIRECTORY` or bib-file-specific PDF directory. This is really something for advanced user.

This is ok, but I don't know the purpose of `FILE_WORKING_DIRECTORY` and I doubt it's working properly, because the variable is set to a full path (with file name). It is really confusing. I mixed up the directories.\n =||= We remove `FILE_WORKING_DIRECTORY` and use `WORKING_DIRECTORY` instead.\n =||= @grimes2 Do you mean \"Main file directory\" and \"Use the BIB file location as primary directory\"?\n =||= Yes. I think this layout is not intuitive. Default \"Main file directory\" should be the working directory.

Integration of custom entry types as `<b:BIBTEX_entry>` seems to be a good idea and can be used for generating appropriate citations in Word. I noticed one more problem, though: the \"Location\"-field of BibTex is not exported correctly. Say, you have set \"Location\" to \"Berlin\".

I will check it.\n`Integration of custom entry types as <b:BIBTEX_entry> seems to be a good idea`\nYeah, I thought the same and theoretically it should already be there, because the field is just calling `entry.getType()` But I will check for custom entry types,too.\n\nIn the meantime I created a help page with all entry and field mappings between JabRef and MsOffice.\nIt is not yet public, but I will try to get it done this afternoon/evening.\n =||= @Mattri  I fixed the location bug.

You soon could try the latest master from here: \nhttp://builds.jabref.org/master/\n =||= @Mattri I just tested to export a custom entry type.

There are a few more issues from my side: since I organize my references with custom entry types (necessary corporate rules) source type is set to \"Misc\" for all of my entries with \"BIBTEX_Entry\" added for the custom entry type. This is OK. However, some fields are ignored and do not show up in the MS-Bib-XML. For example, I use a custom type for reports which includes a field \"key\". This tag is not exported. Same thing with a custom patent-like type containing the field \"number\".\nWould it be possible for the source type \"Misc\" to treat **every** field encountered in the *.bib-file, export it to an appropriate MSBib-XML-tag OR apply  `<b:BIBTEX_myfield>`. In any case, fields should not be omitted  \n =||= Yeah, that should be possible. If you could provide me some sample bib file (if you do not want it public here, send it to developers@jabref.org), I wil test it and check the possibilites.\n =||= I generated a sample file containing a set of custom entry types. All fields should be exported\n\n[sample_file_Mattri.zip](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/files/456583/sample_file_Mattri.zip)\n =||= @Mattri  I just fixed the problems with the key and the number export.

If you think it is a good idea, I will move them as well.\n =||= Looks good! I know that you only copied the methods to new places, but it would be nice to fix those  unnecessary int/char conversions, \n =||= I checked out the PR locally and reviewed the code. I think this PR is a good thing that more or less completes the moving to the model package. I was actually surprised to see that moving `MetaData` was (relatively) feasible. I suggest you go ahead and adjust the structure of the tests, too.\n\nSome remarks / things to improve: \n- Somebody has recreated the event package and added a few events. These should go into the event package in model. Could you perhaps move them as part of this PR and delete the re-introduced top-level event package?\n- I think it would be worthwhile to bundle `MetaData` and its related classes (`SaveOrderConfig`) in a subpackage of model, e.g. `model.metadata`.\n- My IDE marks `MetaData.initializeNewDatabase` as unused. So why not remove it?\n- `BibDatabaseContext` should be moved into `model.database`.\n- I think it would be better to keep `Defaults` in the root package, since it a rather global aspect (a simple one, also). What about changing the type of the `defaults` variable in `BibDatabaseContext` to `BibDatabaseMode`? You would have to modify the constructors, but from what I see it would disentagle `BibDatabaseContext` and `Defaults`.\n- The tie between `BibDatabaseContext` and `DBMSSynchronizer` is not good. We will have to change it sooner or later. However, this need not necessarily be part of this PR.\n- I don't quite like `ModelStringUtil` (and vaguely remember extended discussions with @tobiasdiez  and @simonharrer about such utility classes). How about renaming it to `StringUtil` again? Sure that might result in naming conflicts, but the fact that it is included in `model` already adds that information to that class. And I assume that no class needs to import two `StringUtil` classes anyway, since the methods are just duplicated.\n- I find the propagation of localization not so problematic (especially since no better solution comes to my mind at the moment). It is not in too many positions right now and there will not be many future problems, since the model package is practically complete with this PR.\n- Also the moving of group related aspects (`GroupTreeNode`) is fine by me.\n- Moving parsing/serialization out of the `MetaData` is the right thing to do. After all `BibDatabase` also does not care about this, `BibDatabaseWriter` does. You made the correct decision in my point of view.\n\nI hope this feedback answers your questions :-)\n =||= Thanks for the elaborate feedback.\n\nJust some quick partial comments from the phone:\n\nThere are methods classes that use both StringUtil and ModelStringUtil,\nhence the naming to avoid fully specified paths. Maybe better to duplicate\nthe code then (now they are moved)?\n\nOne out of parsing and serialisation can now easily be moved back\n(serialisation I think, since it is only OS.NEWLINE that must be injected\nand maybe an odd StringUtil method copied/moved). Not sure what is the best\nway. There has also been discussions about self-contained serialisation.\n\nYour package suggestions are fine with me and makes sense. Will implement.\n\nLet's just see how many conflicts I get. ;-)\n =||= Regarding `Defaults` vs `BibDatabaseMode`: I do not really see the point of `Defaults` to start with, but I guess that the idea may be to add more defaults to it. On the other hand,  found this quite interesting piece of code:\n\n``` Java\n        Defaults defaults = new Defaults(BibDatabaseMode.fromPreference(Globals.prefs.getBoolean(JabRefPreferences.BIBLATEX_DEFAULT_MODE)));\n        BibDatabaseMode mode = new BibDatabaseContext(pr.getDatabase(), pr.getMetaData(), defaults).getMode();\n```\n\nSo either these lines have just propagated through a number of refactorings without someone really looking at them or there is something more to it...\n =||= The idea of `Defaults` was to encapsulate more than just the mode inside a Defaults class. Was done by @simonharrer and me on the way back home after JabCon as far as I remember.\n =||= OK, then I leave `Defaults` as is for now.\n =||= I'll mark this PR as a discussion point for the next devcall, since I think there are some...well..points for discussion \ud83d\ude04 \n =||= Our decision at the devcall: @oscargus Please introduce the packages `model.entry.event`, `model.database.event`, `model.groups.event` and sort the relevant events into these packages.

(And then `anykeyword`)\n\n`anyfield contains fruit and anykeyword matches apple`\n =||= Difficult question... To me `anykeyword`  would be okay in this context and it's shorter than singlekeyword.\nE.g thinking of  `anykeyword == \"test\"` it has clear semantics \n =||= Be aware of backwards compatibility.

I would change the search syntax to search for the exact expression vs \"contains\":\n- `keywords == test`: matches only when the content is equal to `test`.\n- `keywords <> test`: matches if it contains `test` as a keyword. (or maybe a different symbol in place of `<>`)\n =||= @JabRef/developers Opinions?\n\nPersonally, I think that adding a search operator which only can be used for a specific field is a bit counter-intuitive. \n =||= I like `anykeywords` better than a new operator.  Especially the search query can be read as a whole sentence and is for the user directly recognizable and has a clear semantic, e.g.`anykeyword contains test`\n\nFor an operator I would expect it to work everywhere, not containing any special semantics for a specific field.\n =||= But one could also have different fields with values separated by some character (\"keyword fields\"). For example, it would make sense to search for entries in specific groups or some user defined fields. But one probably doesn't want to define `any*`-pseudofields for all fields.\n =||= You do have a point, but:\n- there are quite few such fields at the moment\n- the separator discussion is ongoing and far from concluded, less\n  implemented\n- group hierarchies/restoring need to be improved\n- and, also important in this context, I have no idea how to introduce a\n  new operator\n\nHence, this has to be postponed and done by someone else. If it is likely\nto happen we can just put this on hold and see. If it doesn't happen before\n3.7 is released, I suggest we merge this in.\n\nClearly, it would also be much better if `anyfield` didn't have to exist.\nbut any term without a field specified does search in every field, even if\nfields are specified elsewhere. Again, a hypothetical better solution\ncompared to an OK existing.\n\n(Btw, I think that one can already search for groups, although it will be\nin the \"contains\" way to make sense.)\n =||= Alternative: Use [Apache Lucene's Syntax](https://lucene.apache.org/core/2_9_4/queryparsersyntax.html) - see #1975\n =||= We discussed the following at the devcall: The search parser should be extended to support an `any*`  syntax, e.g. it checks if a search term starts with `any`, if so it cuts of the `any` part and tries to use the remaining part as a field name. In this fashion, we would have support for the `any`-functionality for arbitrary fields, which sounds quite cool. Effortwise, it should just require some String manipulation in the query parser. @oscargus Would you be willing to implement this here?\n\nThe long term goal would be to move towards a sophisticated query parser, such as Lucene. However, the effort for this and the required time is quite unsure.\n =||= I do not get it. First, `anyfield` does not apply to the logic described and still needs to be treated separately (and this is really the main thing of this PR). Second, the whole point of `anykeyword` is that one can _split_ the keywords field into smaller parts (and `anykeywords` sounds, ehh, strange...) and match one of these parts (exactly, as contains is more or less the same thing as before). Yes, it might work for e.g. `authors` but I cannot really see the point or how. In that case it may make more sense to be able to match the last name or first name or so, rather than the whole name. The key thing here is how to split the fields and that is field dependent (I can see a few fields where it might work: `related`, `authors`, `file` and there are probably some more. Most it won't make sense for.)\n\nSo, no, as I do not understand how it should be done (in a way that makes sense).\n =||= Dumb question: What currently happens when searching for a keyword? Isn't\nsubstring matching enough?\n =||= Say you have two keywords `aa` and `aaa`. Currently you cannot search for `aa` without also finding `aaa` (assuming there is more than one keyword for each entry, so you need to search for `keywords=aa`). With this PR you can do `anykeyword==aa` and only get entries where one keyword matches `aa` or `anykeyword!=aa` to get entries without that keyword. (`anykeyword=aa` will get both `aa` and `aaa`, so in that case there is not difference to before.)\n =||= OK for me. <s>Just resolve https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/1876/files#r78694966 and then we can merge this in</s>.\n =||= @oscargus based on your description, the problem is not specific to the keywords fields. For example, I can't find the author `aa` without also finding `aaa` and the same for  `aa` in the abstract field. This is why I suggested to use a new comparison operator which checks that the search string is exactly a \"word\" and not just a substring (and for the keywords field we maybe can be so intelligent and only take the keyword separator as word separator). \n\nI think the standard solution is: only match whole words (i.e. `aa` only matches `aa` but not `aaa`) and use wildcard queries like `aa*` to match `aa` as well as `aaa`.\n =||= :+1:  for the wildcard query option. e.g. \\*  and ?\n =||= As I wrote there are a few more fields, yes, put providing a generic split\nis more or less impossible (`and`, `,`, `,`). In addition there are more\nfields that can't be split than the opposite. `anyyear`? `anyissue`?\n`anyabstract`? For author, you more likely want to search for\n`lastname==aa` than `anyauthors==\"a. aa\" or anyauthors==\"aa, a.\"` (not to\nmention you actually search for a specific author, not a specific\nlastname), so adding something similar for names would make sense, but I do\nnot see that as `anyauthors`.\n\nMy suggestion is that we add `any`-support for the fields where it makes\nsense and as this needs to be done specifically for each (class of) field\nit can be done incrementally.\n =||= :+1: - @oscargus please solve https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/1876/files#r78694966, then we can merge and then we can work on other fields in another PR.

Do you need feedback to a specific feature/implementation detail?\n =||= No the general impression and if you believe the implementation is useful for the user.

I think it is enough to have on entry for the highlighted text and its annotation in the left list, details then right.\n =||= I just had a quick look over the code and in general it looks good. \nThe only bigger thing is, that you often coded against an instance instead of an interface (for example PdfCommentImporter vs a general CommentImporter interface). This makes it hard to support different file formats. For example, djvu also has annotations (which might be a better word instead of \"comments\" ?) and it would be nice if we could (later) add support for these, see https://github.com/gthurm/javadjvu/blob/920f36db24f70b7dd9038073ead9c5ad476d8d7a/src/com/lizardtech/djvu/anno/DjVuAnno.java#L361. \nIn a similar direction, I would rename \"PDF comments\" to the more general \"File comments / annotations\"\n =||= I now introduced an Interface for comment importers and renamed the `pdfComment` class to `fileAnnotation`. For consistency I also renamed the tab to `FileAnnotationTab` and changed the Strings referring to PDF to something with File instead. I had also thought about creating an `AbstractFileAnnotation` class, but I think the meta info you want to get from the annotation will probably be the same no matter the format, so you just need to map the annotation to the model classes parameters.  \n =||= I have necountered a problem with the travis-ci check. It fails with: `is net.sf.jabref.logic independent of java.awt?] FAILED` \nThe only awt class used is the awt.geom.Rectangle2D which is needed to extract the highlighted text from a pdf. Can I just ignore the failing check?\n =||= @Braunch  The tests are there to ensure a separation of logic and gui. And as normally the awt classes are associated with gui stuff, they should be not used in logic. \nMabye @lenhard  has an idea for the architecture\n =||= Sorry, but no GUI technology in logic. The check cannot be ignored. I know this is not your fault and you get the dependency from pdfbox. This is rather bad design on side of pdfbox/awt, but we will not bend our architectural constraints for that. Is it possible to implement the text extraction without the awt dependency? If not, than the code needs to go into the gui package.\n\nWhat version of pdfbox is that? We have quite some problems with the library, because the XMP support depends on it and we cannot upgrade it without losing XMP support. This is where our \"dependencys outdated\"-badge comes from.\n =||= Quick hack: net.sf.pdfboxbridge package? \ud83d\ude07\n\n@braunch you find @lenhard s PR for updating PDFBox on the on-hold labelled\nclosed PRs\n =||= The problem is that pdfBox can not extract highlighted text, but text within an area. This area has to be represented by a Rectangle2D. Putting the code into the GUI would be a solution, but it bends the architectural constraints anyway, only the other way round.\n =||= I will have a look at the PR as soon as I am finished with the caching. \n =||= @Braunch You are entirely correct in the view that the gui package is a mess. It is the infamous part of JabRef, where \"anything goes\" and where we quarantine the toxic stuff. That is why putting the code into gui is less of a problem than compromising the logic package.\n\nHere is my PR on upgrading pdfbox: https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/1096\n\n@koppor Wasn't there an attempt in stupro to encode all XMP stuff into dublin core?

This package seems to contain only geometry and logic related classes. There is no real GUI stuff inside and if awt geometry should be needed in the future you would be forced to do all the geometry logic in the jabref.gui packages. I am implementing @koppor s quick hack but to me it looks wrong to have a package with the same architectural hierarchy than net.sf.jabref that only contains one method. \n =||= Why would we need geometry in JabRef? In my honest opinion, the use case here is already quite weird.\n\nAs always in JabRef, things will be decided by consensus of @JabRef/developers I'll vote for making no exception, though.\n =||= Ok then. I pushed the quick hack with the bridge to awt. \n =||= I support @Braunch here and would vote for an exception for `java.awt.geom`.\nReasoning:\n- The `PdfAnnotationImporterImpl` class analyzes pdf files and thus is correctly placed in the logic package (its the same as `BibParser` which analyzes bib files)\n- `awt.geom` has no gui code but is a model class in our terminology (the only reference to gui is that the represented objects have a geometric interpretation)\n- If the same code would be placed in a package with a different name, then there wouldn't be any problem... but names are no more than smoke and mirrors.\n- The hack/workaround https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/1883/commits/31d975b5e81f04937a10a0f9ec547fdd55b447b1 is quite ugly. In the end, the code still depends on `awt.geom`, just that the dependency is indirect and thus our tests are not able to detect it.\n- We will have the same problem with the JavaFX `ObservableLists` which provide a convenient implementation of the list interface (firing events upon update). But they are placed in `\n  javafx.collections` and thus would not be allowed in logic (if we decide to ban `javafx` as we did with `swing/awt`.) \n =||= I would follow the argumentation by @tobiasdiez. As he says names are just hollow words. Add an exception for awt.geom. I took a quick look at the package api doc and it seems like it contains not any logic for drawing, but just proving a model\n =||= So we decided in the devcall that we will create an exception for the `awt.geom` package. So please modify the code of `ArchitectureTests` to exclude the package and I will have a look to see if I like the way in which you implemented it ;-)\n =||= Ok I will change that back and add the exception.\n =||= I added an `exceptionStrings` map that uses the first package as a key and a list of exceptions as value. When checking the imported packages I then filter for packages, that have the first package as key and are imported there. If they are exceptions, they are not added to the list of files. Adding more exceptions is easy. Just add them to the list in the map that belongs to the corresponding key. \n =||= Ok, the test works. In my honest opinion that is a good example that lambdas are hard to understand when they get big. So, could you perhaps just refactor the test a little bit to make it more easily understandable? \n\nWhat I am thinking about is extracting the boolean parts of the lambda into predicates that you define at the start of the method and then just reusing that, i.e.:\n\n```\nPredicate<String> isExceptionPackage = (s) -> (exceptionStrings.get(firstPackage).stream()\n                                .filter(exception -> s.startsWith(\"import \" + exception)).findAny().isPresent()\n                        );\n```\n\nand then you can call\n\n```\n...\n !(isExceptionPackage.test(s))\n...\n```\n\nPlease add and use this predicate and build at least one more nicely named one for another boolean condition. Then the lambda will be much more readable and I promise that I will be happy :-)\n\nP.S.: The localization tests fail, so this needs to be fixed before merging as well.\n =||= That is a good idea. The filters are getting unreadable. But I think I have to rewrite the predicate a bit different, because the predicates are the parameters for the filter and the one you wrote is just one condition for the predicate of another filter so a boolean is expected. I put the whole predicate in it (still a big filter but already way better to read) and extract the isPackage predicate from the filter above too.\n =||= I just had a look at the `ArchitectureTests` and am happy with them. So, from my side this is good to go. Someone else should double check the main functionality, though.\n =||= Is this PR ready for review? (I saw a few \"TODO\" statements in the code, so I suspect it is not yet finished.)\n =||= No its not ready.

This suggests that Microsoft Academic has excellent coverage of what are usually considered to be the most important academic outputs: journal articles and books.\n\nhttp://www.harzing.com/download/mas.pdf\n\nI think Microsoft changed the way how Bing Academics is feed with data. Previously, it was via an own crawler which was then suspended. But now it is connected to Bings main crawler and thus gets good and up-to-date data. Otherwise it wouldn't be listed as part of the [congnitive services](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/academic-knowledge-api) which until recently was a kind of test field or place for beta stage services and now moves on into \"production\".\n =||= It would be nice to have a plugin-system for the whole search stuff. While it is nice to have a large choice of different search-APIs, most are unknown to people not working in that field and every change in the API requires a new version of Jabref. If the search-part would be using a plugin, then you could alter it by yourself and write your own. Also, you could split the maintenance of the search-APIs from the main project and just make it download them on demand...or something like that.\n\nI also don't understand why some of the big players aren't added, such as [WorldCat and many others](http://guides.lib.berkeley.edu/information-studies/apis)\n =||= @Tercus I think, you often heard it in the context of open source projects, but I'll try to rephrase it for the context of JabRef. The JabRef team just consists of volunteers spending their free time for JabRef. They could finish their PhD or PostDoc phase, but they invest time in JabRef, because they just like to. There is no funding agency and the [donations](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/wiki/Donations) are not used for covering our living costs. They are also far from being enough to do so. They are also not enough to pay someone to do work we don't like to.\n\nRegarding the plugins, we decided to drop support for it in the version 3.0. It was not, because plugins are bad per se, but increase our maintenance effort tremendously. We decided that reducing the amount of issues and having more (other) features in JabRef is more important. Moreover, having no plugin support assures that all functions in JabRef remains up to date with other JabRef code. Thus, changing internal data structures does not break any plugin, because we ensure that everything works during in internal change.\n\nHaving the code integrated in JabRef ensures that we do not rely on maintenance of third parties. The experience we have in JabRef is that people are working for JabRef and its plugins during their PhD and then move on to new things. Thus, it is not ensured that a plugin is maintained for a long time. Including it in JabRef really increases the probability that it is maintained. \n\nUsing TravisCI and offering all builds at https://builds.jabref.org/ ensures that fixes in the fetchers are available to the public as fast as possible.\n\nWe are also working on integrating all plugins into JabRef (see https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/152). And we did that for the GVK Fetcher (https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/378/).\n\nRegarding WorldCat - the JabRef user @ChristopherHackett volunteered to work on that: https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/1065.\n\nRegarding other fetchers, I think, the answer is partially given in the first paragraph. If some maintenance work was put away from us (some hard tasks are  listed in #111) would leave some time for us to do these things in JabRef. We also are aware of more than 500 feature requests from the old sourceforge tracker (see https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/wiki/FeatureRequests-Sorted).\n\nWhat would help us, if someone would help maintaining our help pages (see https://github.com/JabRef/help.jabref.org/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md for a guide and https://github.com/JabRef/help.jabref.org/issues for a list of issues to start with), provide answers in the [discourse forum](http://discourse.jabref.org/), and transfer answers from discourse to our help page. Maybe this could be something for you to support JabRef?\n =||= @koppor Thank you for your explanation. I'll try to give back to the project the best I can. I understand that a plugin system would be more work, but at the same time I think that it would easier for people like me to contribute to a plugin that is written in a script-language instead of having to figure out how JabRef works. It is quite daunting, to be honest. But I'll still try.\n\nI work in social sciences and so far, none of the scrapper have been useful.

I'm really missing this feature in JabRef 3.\n\nHowever, the current behavior is a little unexpected. First, the file seems to be moved relative to its current directory. For example directory pattern '\\EntryType' moves the file with every execution of cleanup to a new subdirectory. For me, expected behavior would be, that the new path is relative to the directory of the bib-file or some otherwise specified root directory. \n\nSecond, the file field in the bib entry seems to be adjusted only, if the option 'Use the BIB file location as primary file directory' is set. Otherwise, the file is moved, but the file path is not adjusted.\n =||= @dierkes  Thanks for your feedback. I would have asked you to test it otherwise, too ;)\nThe moving files is a bit complicated as it has to be kept backwards compatible.\n\nThe file directory is the first found directory: a) global file dire from setting b) bib file relative c) bib specific setting (atm not sure about the order b and c)\n\nRegarding the file field, I will check it\n =||= Regarding the new file directory: That's not the behavior I observed.\n\nMy test case was:\noriginal file: phdthesis/xyz_2015.pdf (all paths relative to the bib-file)\nfile name pattern: '\\bibtexkey'\nfile dir pattern: '\\EntryType'\n\ncleanup -> phdthesis/PhdThesis/xyz_215.pdf\ncleanup -> phdthesis/PhdThesis/PhdThesis/xyz_215.pdf\ncleanup -> phdthesis/PhdThesis/PhdThesis/PhdThesis/xyz_215.pdf\n\nIt didn't matter if 'Use the BIB file location as primary file directory' was set or if the default directory for files was set. (I tried with setting it to the directory of the bib-file.) I didn't try to set the default file directory for the specific bib-file, however. (Can do that later.)\n\nFrom my perspective, a backward compatible solution could be: If the file dir pattern is not set, rename the file in its current location. If it is set, move the file to the directory specified by file dir pattern (relative to bib-file directory, if it's a relative path) and rename it there. However, an empty file name pattern could mean a) rename the file in place or b) move file to bib-file directory, so an additional option is probably necessary, that specifies whether moving files is active or not.\n\nInterpreting the file dir pattern as a path relative to the current directory of the file doesn't make sense to me, since executing cleanup would always change the file path.

There was some directory path which was just \"\" and not null, so it was resolved to the current dir of the jar.  Now it only renames the file.\nAnd the old behaviour now works, too, when fileDirPattern is Empty, the file is moved to the file directory, \nThe file directories are checked in this order:\n The settings are prioritized in the following order and the first defined setting is used\n1. metadata user-specific directory\n2. metadata general directory\n3. preferences directory\n4. BIB file directory\n =||= This works, almost. ;-)\n\nI encountered a similar problem when dragging a file and dropping it to an entry. When I select to move the file, again instead of a file a directory is created (same path as the file should have).\n =||= And another issue: If multiple files are linked to an entry, the first file is renamed and the other file links get lost. In JabRef 3.6 the first file is renamed and the other files are moved to the same directory.\n =||= Thanks for your intenstive testing.\nThe issue with the drag and drop is now fixed.  There was a problem with the layout which would have been default to bibtexkey if the pattern param is empty.\n\nI am aware of the thing with the multi files. As far as I discovered the first successful rename/move exits the function. Will try to find out why. Not sure if I find time for it next week.\n\nAddtionally I will create some automatic tests, too if it works finally..\n =||= I think, I fixed the issue with the multiple files, see #2248.\n\nThe behavior now, as far as I understand it, is: The function will try to move/rename all attached files. If a file with the new file path already exist (that happens if two attached files have the same file extension), it doesn't move/rename the file and keeps the old file path in the bib entry.\n\nFor example, let's consider we have three attached files:\nOldDir1/OldName1.pdf\nOldDir2/OldName2.pdf\nOldDir3/OldName3.txt\n\nThe new file paths will be:\nNewDir/NewName.pdf\nOldDir2/OldName2.pdf\nNewDir/NewName.txt\n\nI think, there is some room for improvement. For example, to keep OldName2 but move the file to NewDir, if possible. However, before doing this, I think it's necessary to define the desired behavior in detail.\n =||= Thanks for your work! Just one thing, it would be nice if you could check that locally, too.\nThere is a junit test I set to ignore (due to the bug) which should now work, too. Just remove the ignore-Tag\nand  execute it (either directly  or run gradlew check)\n\n`cleanupRenamePdfRenamesWithMultipleFiles()` in  `src/test/java/net/sf/jabref/logic/cleanup/CleanupWorkerTest.java`\n =||= I removed the tag.\n\nWhen I run `gradlew check`, the test `cleanupRenamePdfRenamesRelativeFile()` in `CleanupWorkerTest.java` fails. However, I think the problem lies within the design of the test. The expected path of the file is `Toot.tmp`, but the actual path is `Misc/Toot.tmp`. I guess, there is some default value set for fileDirPattern.\n =||= Hm I think the value has to be set to an empty string in the test because\notherwise it will take the value of the settings.\n\nAm 10.11.2016 12:57 vorm. schrieb \"dierkes\" notifications@github.com:\n\n> I removed the tag.\n> \n> When I run gradlew check, the test cleanupRenamePdfRenamesRelativeFile()\n> in CleanupWorkerTest.java fails.

Usually, all entries of a group have a white background, while those which do not belong to the group, have a grey background. Furthermore, all entries of a group are shown at the top of the \"main table/database view\", while non-members are shown below the group members. The new entry, however, is not displayed in such a way - instead, it is still treated as a non-member, i. e. it has a grey background and it is not grouped together with other group members at the top of the \"main table/database view\".\n4.

This is not the case with newly assigned items. It does appear, however, that this feature is generally buggy - also items that have not been newly assigned to a group are not always coloured in the group panel (sometimes it works, sometimes it does not). Should I open a new bug report for this? =||= @AEgit Thanks, I am glad to hear that :-)\r\n\r\nRegarding coloring: It also occurred to me that this doesn't work reliably.

(Which I think is a quite reasonable way to implement it.)\n =||= @oscargus \n\nI was thinking about a search box in the groups sides panel - the issue with filtering is, that you still have to scroll in the group side panel, if you want to see the actual group (not just the articles entries associated with the group). Reason for this could be, that you want to assign the group to another group (as a subgroup) - currently that can only be done by scrolling to the actual group.\n\nFurthermore, by filtering you are not able to see entries, that are part of a subgroup of the group that you are searching for.\n\nSo, if it is possible, I would really appreciate to see an additional search box in groups side panel to filter out groups.\n =||= Good idea!\nI think, I'll try to implement it during the redesign of the groups interface (work-in-progress, https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/1438).\n =||= Now that version 3.7 has been released, could we reopen this please?

Progress is tracked at #2290. Once this is done, we reopen every issue tagged with \"after-migration-to-javafx\".\r\n- Then we will implement the rest of the groups interface and so finish #1438.\r\n- Finally, we have can implement new features as search for groups etc.  =||= Thank you very much!

Worth noting is that `iconName` is not really used anymore.

So, either we adapt the interface to our material icons (see e.g., https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/1549#issuecomment-242361637) or just drop the icon completely. As first step, I would rename `icon` to `materialDesignIconCodePoint` and drop `icon` completely.\n =||= You are correct. However, since it is not possible to edit the icon the removed methods are not needed.\n\nI noted that I made a mistake though so this cannot be merged yet.\n =||= Once done it should be possible to split external into gui and logic in a way that makes sense.\n\nProblem 1: the mapping between icon name and codepoint is in IconTheme in gui. As the codepoint is needed in `ExternalFileType` and `ExternalFileTypes` it would be nice to move the mapping outside of `gui`. However, it is not obvious to me if this can be obtained with the code looking as nicely as it is now.\n\nI guess having a set of constant strings would be one option, so in IconTheme it looks like `BLOG(IconMapping.BLOG)` instead of `BLOG(\"\\uf46b\")` and in IconMapping (in logic) like `public static final String BLOG = \"\\uf46b\"`, but this isn't really nice. (Maybe one can use enum?)\n\nProblem 2: The OpenOffice icon used was not from material design. Hence, there is currently no icon. \n\nProblem 3: Migration is not really working yet. As the fifth argument earlier the icon name was saved (which wasn't really used anyway), now the code point is saved. An option may be to save a sixth argument saying if the fifth is icon name or code point. This will also solve problem 2.\n =||= The objective would be to move `ExternalFileType` and `ExternalFileTypes` to `logic` as a cleanup is dependent on them. The rest should move to gui (from a quick check).\n =||= Regarding the distinction of the icon names and code points: As far as I understand, code points always start with `\\`, whereas I would expect icon names to never start with `\\`. So a very simple detection would be: `boolean isCodePoint = myIconOrCodePoint.startsWith(\"\\\\\");` That could solve problem 2 and 3, right?\n\nRegarding the refactoring of `ExternalType` / `ExternalFileTypes` to get them into logic: The problem is that the classes store an `Icon`. Wouldn't it be possible to replace this instance variable with the code point / icon name, which is just a String? Then, we would need a facility in gui that accepts an `ExternalFileType` and builds an icon from. I have no idea what the effort is for implementing this, though...\n\nEDIT: Nevermind, just looking at the code I see that saving a String instead of an Icon is exactly what you have been doing. The problem is in `IconTheme`. I have a meeting now and will update my comment afterwards.\n =||= But changing the type from Icon to String, doesn't change the fact that the information is still GUI-related, does it? It's just isn't in-your-face anymore. If you really want to move some part of it to the logic package, then I see no other way then to split it as follows:\n- ExternalFileType in logic without any icon information\n- ExternalFileTypeWithIcon in gui, deriving from ExternalFileType and providing access to the icon\n- Some conversion code which enriches a given ExternalFileType by the icon based on some hard-coded map\n\nBut this is probably not worth the effort. In fact, ExternalFileType seems to be used (almost?) exclusively by editors and file dialogs and thus could happily reside in gui, right? Do I overlook something? \n =||= @tobiasdiez : I did something similar with FileList half a year ago, splitting into a gui free version and an \"extended\" one, which was not an appreciated solution then. Yes, it is GUI related primarily, but there is logic code that uses it.\n\n@lenhard : I did a move right now which is architecturally correct (except that I haven't bothered to remove Globals yet). Not nice, but the only way I see to enable moving parts to logic.\n =||= @tobiasdiez is right of course. If we remove the icon information from `ExternalFileType` completely, it could (and should) even go into model, since it is just a class that represents data.\n\nThe map to icons is currently stored in `ExternalFileTypes`, but it should be possible to extract that code to a new GUI class and, as far as I can see, this is the only GUI-specific code.\n\nThe `ExternalFileTypes` are mostly used in the gui, but there is some logic code (`UpgradePdfPsToFileCleanup`) and the `pdfimport` code that uses it. Also, we have `ParsedFileField` in `model`, which uses a `fileType` through which it indirectly links `ExternalFileType` via Strings. The problem seems to be somewhat subtle.\n\nI think the cleanest solution would be to extract `ExternalFileTyp` into model and sort of duplicate it in gui to add the icon information to it. @JabRef/developers What do you think?\n\nBtw.: We have the same problem with special fields, which are in a sense `model`, but store an `Icon`.\n\nEdit: @oscargus My comment came to late and I did not see yours before, sorry! How about moving `ExternalFileType` and `ExternalFileTypes` into model?\n =||= The code point is actually not starting with \\ as I understand it, it is just a way to enter unicode characters, so it should be stored as the character (still, the length of that is one character, not several). Haven't come that far though so I can confirm it.\n =||= @lenhard No worries. I did the latest edits without realizing that there were valuable input to the process... I guess `ExternalFileType` could reside in `model` for sure. `ExternalFileTypes` currently require localization. Somehow, extending `ExternalFileType` as you and @tobiasdiez suggest should also be OK (`ExternalFileTypeWithIcon extends ExternalFileType` with an additional `Icon` field), but it is not completely clear how to deal with `ExternalFileTypes`. Having two lists (`ExternalFileTypes` and `ExternalFileTypesWithIcons`) should be OK, the question is more how to generate them... Not really clear how to deal with it as the logic one is easily created from the gui one, but a call to `getInstance()` in the logic one, cannot get information from the gui one... This can of course be solved by a call to `getInstance()` early in the code, although that is not really the preferred approach... The risk of duplicating to much is that we will need to edit it in two places...\n\n`SpecialFields` is indeed a similar issue that needs to be resolved.\n =||= An alternative approach is maybe to hard code the file types for ps and pdf (`PS` and `PDF`), which is really what `ExternalFileTypes` is used for in `UpgradePdfPsToFileCleanup`. One might think based on the class name that it is enough to cover ps and pdf files... (It is also used for `evostar_pdf` in the migration but it may be OK to drop that now I think, no idea what it is and no default support for it apart from this.)\n =||= @oscargus: Hard coding `ps` and `pdf` in the upgrade functionality and dropping `evostar_pdf` seems reasonable to me! After all, the fields are already \"hard-coded\" in the methods name.\n\nRegarding the duplication, I fail to come up with a satisfying solution at the moment...\n =||= So this PR is superfluously after #1934?\n =||= "], ["1925", "Add ID Fetcher in Entrytypedialog", "Sascha Zeller", "zesaro", "09/12/16, 07:50:09 PM", "Add an extra field in the EntryTypeDialog to fetch the ID Based fetcher. \nThe field is in on the bottom of the dialog and is named `ID based generator`.\n- [ ] DoiFetcher merged #1885 \n- [ ] AdsFetcher merged #1923 \n- [x] Change in CHANGELOG.md described\n- [ ] Tests created for changes\n- [x] Screenshots added (for bigger UI changes)\n- [x] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef\n\nNormal\n![dialog30-f](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15339867/18432299/80f67c74-78e1-11e6-8d0e-39199d926c65.png)\n\nSearching\n![dialog31-f](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15339867/18432306/8d7e8482-78e1-11e6-8dc9-69f9114b144e.png)\n\nNo internet connection\n![dialog34-f](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15339867/18432309/94af4598-78e1-11e6-8659-a24558849530.png)\n\nError message\n![fetcher35-f](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15339867/18443868/20db5cf2-7917-11e6-8b10-5da98b19536f.png)", "To make it a bit clearer for the user, I would rename it \"From ID based fetcher\".\nSo the semantic workflow could be  \"create new entry from isbn 12346567\"\n =||= Or just \"From ID\".\n\nI think the idea is really good, but I'm thinking that there may be a better location, like a separate menu item.

Typing a string to be searched into the search field on the top left of the window.\n2. At the same time, the entry editor (at the bottom) is open.\n3. Problem: Sometimes (didn't find the pattern) the text-cursor jumps away from the search field into one of the slots of the entry editor. From that point on, typing happens not in the search field but in the slot of the entry editor. This can cause retyping (so: deletion and then typing) of some of the information within the entry editor. (Luckily, this can undone by the Undo command.)\n\nEssentially, this problem makes me search only when the entry editor is closed/deactivated. Pretty annoying.\n\n<!-- If applicable, excerpt of the bibliography file, screenshot, and excerpt of log (available in the error console) -->\n\n```\nPut the excerpt of the log file here\n```", "I can confirm this problem - unfortunately I've also not been able to find the pattern behind it, so I did not report the bug.\n =||= Same for me with JabRef 3.6 on Windows 10 (1511). The cursor jumps away sometimes (but not every time) when the partial search term is a valid text completion. For example, searching for \"bilateral\" may mean that the cursor jumps away after \"bi\" as this is the surname of some author (Bi). But this is somehow not reproducible.\n =||= I have been trying to reproduce this, but fail to do so. My cursor stays in the search field, also with search terms that are valid text completions.\n\nSorry, but as long as we haven't found a way of reproducing this, there is also no chance of fixing it.\n =||= It's frustrating. I just sat down to try to find the pattern, but have failed to reproduce the effect even once. I want to mention two points, just in case they help others look for the pattern:\n- The target of the jumping was often (though not exclusively) the field \"Crossref\". The field is always empty in my database, so it's not the case that the target of the jumping is the string being searched for.\n-  My impression is that slow typing won't cause the jumping effect. It only seems to happen when I'm typing with all 10 fingers, in a significant speed.\n- Don't know whether this matters, but my database is fairly large, containing 6000 entries.\n\nI'll try to observe this further and let you know once I know more. The bug is pretty annoying mainly because it has a potential to mess up my carefully built database. I already started having bibtex-compilation problems because I've unintentionally added strings that caused trouble (e.g. into the \"Crossref\" field).\n =||= I've also tried to reproduce it, but as you say it kind of happens in a random way. One point that you mention is interesting: You have a large database and so have I (currently >8000 entries). It would be interesting to see, if everyone who is affected, has a large database.\n\nI also tried to reproduce the problem with a smaller database, but there it never happened (but I have to say, I only tried this for a couple of minutes, so maybe that's the reason).\n =||= Please try our latest build at https://builds.jabref.org/master. We worked on the search bar and it should be much better now.\n =||= @bartsch-dev Could you have a look at it? Use a large database with 10.000 entries.\n =||= The bug is back and I have some new observations:\n\nInitial conditions (the first one is necessary, the second one maybe not):\n1. The entry editor is open.\n2. The cursor is within one of the fields of the entry editor.\n\nSearch & jump:\n1. I intend to type \"lenertova\" in the search field.\n2. I type \"l\" and the cursor immediately jumps into the entry editor, so I type \"en\" there before I manage to stop.\n3. The place where it jumped was the top field of the entry editor - the Author field (in case the \"General\" tab was active, it jumped into the top field of that tab, i.e. Crossref).\n4. It didn't delete the author, instead, the \"en\" was written immediately after the string already contained in that Author field (this corresponds to just starting to write into the Crossref field in case the \"General\" tab is active).\n5. The entry it jumped into was the first one in the database that found some \"l\". That means that it was the very first one because virtually any entry contains an \"l\".\n\nThis is reproducible. I just tried searching for \"kratzer\", while having the \"General\" tab open. After writing \"kra\", the jump happened (to the first entry containing the string \"kra\" within the \"General\" tab), making me write \"tz...\" into the Crossref field of that entry.\n\nHope this helps!\n =||= @radeksimik: Did you try the new master build?

The translation files had to be reworked as the console error dialog has been merged in the meantime. And the controller of the error console fxml file had to be extracted from the view class, same as it was the case with the manage journal abbreviations dialog.

If I open the same database with JabRef 3.7dev--snapshot--2016-09-16--master--629c3f0 I have to wait a couple of seconds for search results (and you also hear the CPU cooling unit spinning up, indicating that more processing power is needed (this is not the case with Jabref 3.6).\n\nIf I send you the database, however, I would ask you not to share it or make it publicly available, as it may contain sensible information (preferentially you would delete the file, once it is no longer needed).\n =||= @AEgit ok, thanks! You can send it to joerg.lenhard@kau.se Then I will see how search works with my machine and delete your file afterwards.\n\nIt would be cool if one day we had a huge file for JabRef for testing purposes. Maybe we could go for auto-generated entries, but then again randomized data will never be representative of real actual data.\n =||= I can confirm the performance problems with a DB of 6000 entries. \n@lenhard there is one big file of mine in the admin rep.\n@AEgit You don't need to send your file.

Yea, I prefer it if I can avoid sending the file - maybe once I'll have the time to go through the database and delete all the stuff, that shouldn't be public, I could make it available (but currently I don't have the time). As pointed out by lenhard, the changes that let to the performance drop must have happened between the following two builds:\n\nJabRef 3.7dev--snapshot--2016-09-16--master--4913665\nJabRef 3.7dev--snapshot--2016-09-16--master--629c3f0\n =||= I made some quick tests and the entry search in the searchworker is about 8 times slower since 543c176200ec793d1272fc65fd763492ebd3105a than before.\nhttps://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/master/src/main/java/net/sf/jabref/gui/search/SearchWorker.java#L43\nTo be precise it is the `collect`part of the lambda.\n =||= Making the stream a parallelStream makes it significantly better but still worse than before (around 2 times slower).\n =||= @bartsch-dev You bet me by 17 seconds with suggesting parallelization ;) Well, 2 times slower is better than 8 times slower.\n\nAnyways, if lambda expressions cause the delay we should probably think about re-implementing performance-critical operations in the old style. @bartsch-dev can you reimplement that fragment in an interative style and see how it performs? \nSomething like (this is pseudocode)\n\n``` Java\nfor(Entry entry: database.getEntries()){\n  if(searchQuery.matches(entry)) {\n    myLinkedList.add(entry);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nCare to use a `LinkedList` since it performs in O(1) (meaning in constant time) for invocations of add.\n =||= It's not really the lambda that causes that problem.\nIf I insert the same lambda one commit before (not that I changed it in any remarkable way) it performs much better.\n =||= Well, the `search()` benchmark just uses the `SearchQuery` directly (without the SearchWorker). And even there the performance is 8 times slower.\n =||= Could it be related to the Unicode stuff?\n =||= Just to keep everyone updated: I've tried the most recent snapshot (JabRef 3.7dev--snapshot--2016-09-27--master--b8d1c2e), but it is still clearly slower than previous versions. I will fall back again to the latest release version JabRef 3.6.\n =||= I played around a little bit, and got following benchmark (note the score of the parallel search which is much higher than the search before the performance issue):\n\n```\nBenchmark                             Mode  Cnt         Score        Error  Units\nBenchmarks.htmlToLatexConversion     thrpt   20      5017.331 \u00b1    173.848  ops/s\nBenchmarks.inferBibDatabaseMode      thrpt   20     21474.468 \u00b1    542.497  ops/s\nBenchmarks.keywordGroupContains      thrpt   20     12074.752 \u00b1   1167.932  ops/s\nBenchmarks.keywordGroupContainsWord  thrpt   20  12975699.817 \u00b1 295384.417  ops/s\nBenchmarks.latexToHTMLConversion     thrpt   20    100085.982 \u00b1  11105.766  ops/s\nBenchmarks.latexToUnicodeConversion  thrpt   20    105671.959 \u00b1   5261.769  ops/s\nBenchmarks.parallelSearch            thrpt   20       525.198 \u00b1     42.728  ops/s\nBenchmarks.parse                     thrpt   20        34.981 \u00b1      1.116  ops/s\nBenchmarks.removeLatexCommands       thrpt   20    816118.612 \u00b1  33977.863  ops/s\nBenchmarks.search                    thrpt   20       320.303 \u00b1      7.338  ops/s\nBenchmarks.write                     thrpt   20        69.749 \u00b1      1.551  ops/s\n```\n\nThe problem is that in the PR where I changed the searchbar I changed the `ContainBasedSearchRule` too.\nBefore the string about to be searched was stripped from all latex commands thus not recognizing `{\\\"a}` as `\u00e4` but as `a`.\nRemoving all Latex commands is about 8 times quicker than converting them to Unicode (see Benchmark above).\n\nRefs #518 \n =||= Hmmm, indeed, your benchmark results indicate that the parallel search is much faster than the initial one. I guess that the change to the ContainBasedSearchRule, however, has such a high impact on the performance (indeed, you mention it to be 8 times quicker before the change), that the increased performance in the parallel search is not able overcome the overall problem, i.e., that the search still is still much slower than it was previously.\nAs far as I understand, the way the search is currently implemented, works as it SHOULD, as Latex commands are interpreted correctly (while before they were not). This correct behaviour, however, causes a major performance issue for large databases (which contain many Latex commands that need to be converted to Unicode? - What about databases, which don't contain much that needs to be converted?).\n\nIf it is not possible to solve the problem in another way: Would it be possible to implement a switch which enables the user to activate either the \"fast search\" (which does not convert the Latex commands) or the \"slow/correct search\" (which does convert the Latex commands - with the associated performance drop)? I guess it is just a workaround, but that might be a solution?\n =||= First of all, it is a good thing if we have found the component that is causing the trouble, good job @bartsch-dev \n\nIt will probably make no difference if the database contains LaTeX characters or not, I think it is the searching for LaTeX in `LatexToUnicode` that is causing the problem. There is some potential for performance optimization in the code in this class, for instance by using pre-compiled regular expressions instead of the `replaceAll` statements, but I doubt this will really solve the problem. I am also against providing a configuration option for turning this off (sorry @AEgit ), since workarounds have a tendency to turn into permanent solutions. Either we do it right, or we leave it, but no more hacks that make future feature implementation harder.\n\n#518 is a possible long-term solution. However, if we compute a LaTeX-free version of every field on every change, load times of databases might go up significantly (which could be a compromise. Normally, you load once and might search often). Also other features might be affected. On the other side, we can of course circumvent increased load-times by implementing a cache-based version (computing LaTeX-free field content on demand). Then, the first search would be slow, but subsequent ones fast. All in all, I think this solution, including the cache, is worthwhile. @JabRef/developers What do you think other implications would be? Should we go for implementing #518?\n =||= I think we should discuss this one day in a devcall. But in general it looks like this is the only long term solution we have.  But I do not really understand why people keep latex encoded entries in their db, as normally all modern text writing programs support UTF-8.  \nI mean, we have a cleanup operation already for removing latex. \n =||= IMHO there are two obvious solutions for this to speed things up:\n1. Keep an extra map with already latex free fields\n2. Convert everything to latex free strings\n\nI just tried the first option, the gained performance is enormous (https://github.com/bartsch-dev/jabref/commit/7a9740a758146f3af5016a42af73b5ba93298cda):\n\n```\nBenchmark                   Mode  Cnt     Score     Error  Units\nBenchmarks.parallelSearch  thrpt   20  1200.462 \u00b1 125.105  ops/s\nBenchmarks.search          thrpt   20   650.013 \u00b1  53.531  ops/s\n```\n =||= Option 1 goes in the direction of \"store latex free version\" #518. \nWhat I don't understand is that it actually works for the benchmark. I thought the benchmark works as follows:\n- Create DB with a lot of entries\n- Search for one term\n- Start at beginning\n\nThus every entry should be asked about its fields exactly once. Thus caching shouldn't affect the benchmark. \n\nSince I'm not a big fan of caching (it makes development harder in general, since you often have to change two things), I would propose to improve performance of the unicode to latex formatter instead. I'll have a look at it during the weekend if nobody wants to do it before (@bartsch-dev: ?)\n =||= The latex free field gets stored as soon as the field gets set (thus the database needs about double the space it did before), not when it gets accessed.\nThe benchmark just measures the time the search takes, not the time the database needs to get initialized.\n\nI'm away over the long weekend. You can try your luck (I opt for option 2, where do we the strings with latex commands anyway, except saving the database to disk which only occurs if the user enters the special characters in latex style).\n =||= Regarding caching: There is no point of improving performance if JabRef dies for large databases due to memory usage. @AEgit What is the current memory footprint for your 8000+ entry database? Will it be a problem for your enviroment if JabRef takes up twice of what it currently does?\n =||= On Windows 10 Jabref currently uses ~1.4 GB of RAM for a database with nearly 9,000 entries (and several hundreds of groups). Doubling the memory footprint would be no issue for me, as I'm running this on a machine with 16 GB of RAM.\n =||= @AEgit  Just a question: Do you have the 64-Bit version of Java installed?\n =||= Yes I have.\n =||= I note that I pointed this out as a probable reason quite some time ago. ;-)\n\n@Siedlerchr There are for sure still use cases for non-UTF-8 databases. IEEE is just one.\n =||= Plain LaTeX is important for so many users. For instance, when publishing scientific papers. Nearly no publisher supports biblatex. And [bibtex8](https://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/biblio/bibtex/8-bit) still seems to be a hack and is 20 years old now. Sure, [switching to biblatex is recommended](http://tex.stackexchange.com/a/8416/9075), but not practical.\n =||= I doubt that caching the UTF-8 string (\"latex-free version\") takes twice as memory, because I assume that 80% of the Strings will be the same. The latex-free version can use [String.intern()](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#intern%28%29) to reduce memory consumption drastically (see also http://stackoverflow.com/q/10578984/873282). We can also add `-XX:+UseG1GC -XX:+UseStringDeduplication` as JVM arguments, if we don't want to use `intern()`. See also http://stackoverflow.com/a/27953779/873282.\n =||= @oscargus Indeed, your intuition paved the way :-)\n@koppor Sure it does not take twice the memory. That is just the worst-case upper bound estimation, which we should take into account in a design decision anyway.\n\nSummarizing the discussion, I think we have a consensus that something will be done. We currently have the following options:\n1. Performance optimization of `LatexToUnicode`\n2. Duplicate storage of LaTeX-free field values in `BibEntry`\n3. Solution 2 plus Caching in `BibEntry`\n4. Solution 2 plus hand-coded String internalization\n5. Solution 2 plus additional JVM arguments\n6. A combination of 3 plus 4, or 3 plus 5\n\nLet us decide which way to go at the next devcall!\n =||= I think rewriting the converters would make sense anyway. I have just touched them, but there are at least three(?) places where the conversion map is checked, which seems quite redundant. I haven't really studied it in depth, but it may be possible to write a faster converter from scratch with a selectable conversion map (to deal with Latex to {Unicode, HTML, XML, RTF}), although unification and speed may be contradictory... \n\nA first step might be to profile the LatexToUnicode converter to see where the actual bottleneck is.\n =||= It is not my place to say this, as I'm not an active developer: But, would it be possible for you to go for the quickest solution among the ones mentioned so that I can switch to the new developer version. Because currently I can't and because of that I can also not use Google Scholar (see recent posts here: https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/1886), which is quite essential to my work (much of it has no DOI but is found by Google Scholar).\n\nAgain, this is just a suggestion and apologies if I'm overstepping a boundary as a passive user who doesn't help in actively developing this wonderful piece of software.\n =||= @AEgit if you desperately want a development version with quicker search, then you can get one right now here: http://builds.jabref.org/latex-free-fields/\n\nThis should be somewhat faster already. I'll do a few more minor improvements tomorrow and I have also not yet tested as to how much faster this actually is and how much memory it consumes. But it would be interesting to hear from you how search performs anyway. The first search run should still be pretty slow, but subsequent ones would be faster.\n\n@oscargus I am doing a few minor optimizations in the LatexToUnicode, but a rewrite would probably the most reasonable option. I have to say that I barely understand what that algorithm does...\n =||= JabRef 3.7dev--snapshot--2016-09-29--latex-free-fields--93e665e\nwindows 10 10.0 amd64 \nJava 1.8.0_101\n\n@lenhard : Thank you so much!!!\nThis is indeed much faster - it feels as if it was even faster than before the issue (maybe due to the parallel optimizations?). Google Scholar works as well: Great!\n\nThe memory footprint seems to be nearly the same: I think there's a max. increase of 200 MB (Jabref is now using 1.6 GB instead of 1.4 GB) - but that is negligible on my machine. I think it also uses more CPU power - at least initially I heard my fans spinning up: Again, no issue for me, as I'm running this on a quite powerful Core i7 laptop.\nSo far I did not run into any (major) bugs.\n\nThank you very much!\n =||= Ok, small bug spotted in JabRef 3.7dev--snapshot--2016-09-29--latex-free-fields--93e665e\n\nIt's no longer possible to assign an article to a group by drag'n'drop. If I try that, nothing happens. Instead I have to manually enter the groups name in the \"Groups\" field: Then it works.\n\n(I didn't know whether I should open a new ticket as you mentioned that you would do a few minor improvements tomorrow anyway)\n =||= @AEgit That is great to hear :-) I will do some more testing tomorrow, but it sounds like we are getting this issue solved. It is also good that the additional memory needed seems to be acceptable. If so, then that is certainly due to the suggestions by @koppor\n\nThe groups bug you mention should be unrelated and I only touch the LaTeX converter tomorrow, so please open a new issue.  \n =||= Another small bug in JabRef 3.7dev--snapshot--2016-09-29--latex-free-fields--93e665e\n\nThe DOI resolver does not appear anymore in the Web search interface.\n =||= The DOI resolver is now in BibTeX -> New entry\n =||= @mlep \nThank you! Hmmm, would it be possible to readd the DOI fetcher to the Web search? Because now I have to make at least one additional click/use one additional shortcut to enter the DOI and get the bibtex data. Beforehand I could just enter the doi in the Web search that was already open.\n =||= Would it help to press CTRL n and then the Input field is focussed?\n =||= Hmmm, yes, I was already using CTRL+N and focussing the input field would help - but it's not as convenient as it was before. At least I think so - maybe I just need to get used to it: But changing the focus to the input field would definitely help.\n =||= @zellerdev\n =||= Another small bug I came across in JabRef 3.7dev--snapshot--2016-09-29--latex-free-fields--93e665e\n1.

If we select now another article in the same group that is also found by the search, the entry preview is not shown - it still shows the previous article\n6.
