XMP is an extremely interesting feature that allows tagging PDF files (amongst others) with automatically retrievable metadata in much the same way mp3-tags allow adding title/author/... information to mp3 music files. Actually JabRef exports the metadata not only to two XMP namespaces (Dublin Core and a custom JabRef namespace), but also to the PDF DocumentInformation Object.\n\nPractically from the beginning of the XMP-writing capabilities of JabRef, Christopher Oezbek had added _privacy filtering_ for the XMP-tagging of PDF-files with data from the bibtex-record, meaning that the user could define a list of fields (in Preferences->XMP metadata) which should _not_ be exported to the PDF file.  Unfortunately, the filtering was incomplete: jabref exports the metadata in three different forms, only one of which was originally filtered. In 2013 filtering was extended to both XMP namespaces, but JabRef still exported _all_ fields into the PDF DocumentInfo object. The two present commits correct this problem. The first (b45316f) prevents private fields from being exported to the PDF DocumentInfo. The second one more agressively erases these fields even if they already exist in the PDF document. \n\nThe deletion of existing fields might be debateable. It seems the right thing to do for fields clearly generated by JabRef (viz. those prefixed by \"jabref/\"), but there are four fields which might be of other origin (Author,Title,Subject and Keywords). Making a systematic exception for these four fields, i.e. not erasing them even if they are privacy filtered, is a bad idea and violates the principle of least surprise. This is why the second commit makes no exception. Deactivating the erasure for the four generic fields could however easily be added as an option in the XMP export preferences if it is judged important. The current behaviour has the advantage of reliably correcting PDF files previously tagged with a buggy privacy filtering.\n\nIf these commits are pulled into the master branch and confirmed to work, the bug #869 on the sourceforge tracker: \nhttps://sourceforge.net/p/jabref/bugs/869/\ncan be closed.", "thx!\n =||= "], ["9", "Support FindFullText with ACS DOIs", "Peter Ansell", "ansell", "05/20/14, 12:53:43 PM", "Adds a FullTextFinder implementation to transform the ACS DOI redirect URLs to their PDF download equivalents.", "NaN"], ["10", "try to fix some obvious bugs about `groups`", null, "braindevices", "05/20/14, 12:55:20 PM", "Hi All,\nI just upgraded to 2.10 and I found some bugs immediately.\n1. in the right-click-menu there is no `move-to-group` but 2 `remove\nfrom group` instead.\n2.

(as you see this is not my prefer display style)\n\nIn general, I conclude that:\n- Help should be expanded.\n- The search GUI should be reorganized to avoid mixing things, no?\n =||= I suggest to make it simpler by\n- removing incremental search\n- make float the default search and hide the other options\n- bring caseSensitive and isRegex to the front as they have an impact on the search results\n\nI do not have good suggestions on scope and the dialog option, as they are intertwined. A global search always opens up in a dialog. \n =||= Currently, the various possibilities take 6 lines. Let's try to keep it as compact, or even smaller\nHere is the design I suggest:\n- Floating | Filter | New window\n  (a dropdown menu with the 3 possibilities, which displays the selected one)\n- Local | Global\n  (and selecting global automatically selects New window and invalidates the possibility of selecting Floating or Filter)\n- RegEx (on/off)\n- Case sensitive (on/off)\n- Parameters\n  (\"Parameters\" is always displayed)\n  - Autocomplete (on/off)\n  - Highlight (on/off)\n\nOnly 5 lines, and still explicit about the (important) choices\n\nBTW, why not to contact our GUI specialist?\n =||= Minor comment: pressing `ctrl`+`f` when the focus is on the search field, the type of the search changes. I would vote to remove this functionality and just highlight the searched word as Firefox does.\n =||= Ahhh, instead of 103 what I should have written in the commit message I wrote 104. What a mess.\n =||= I think this is related to #162\n =||= In #162, there is also the \"live\" option which does everything after each keystroke. \n =||= Current road map for the new search\n- [x] remove incremental search\n- [x] remove select matches option\n- [x] remove autocomplete on/off option and make this on by default\n- [x] make float search live\n- [x] handle global/local and in window/new window: \n\nThis should reduce the complexity of the search. \n =||= Can you please elaborate on why the incremental and filter search should be removed?\nI agree that the incremental search is an edge case and probably not very often used, but the filter option is in my opinion very important. Indeed, it is my standard search mode. There are a few use cases where filter is superior to float (and not just an optical difference). For example, filtering items and then Control + A, followed by some action allows to easily apply the action just to the filtered items. \n\nBut even the incremental search has some use cases. It is a good search mode whenever the context of the other non-matched items is important (which is admittedly not very often). (This is why Control + G jumps to the given position in most text editors instead of just displaying the single line :mask:)\n\nIn my opinion, the search is one of the most underdeveloped areas in JabRef and I can't see how removing search modes helps here. (Indeed, quite often I don't understand why some features should be removed. It would be ok if we try to implement something new and the old code posses a problem. Then removing the old feature is ok in my eyes. But just removing for the purpose of removing is not very profitable.) \n =||= JabRef at the moment has a few issues:\n- Most of the code is untested, undocumented and contains a lot of bugs/issues.\n- Over the lifetime of JabRef, a lot of features, UI elements and preferences were added. All of them are loosely fit together in the UI, but the UI lacks consistency and structure. \n\nThis makes working on JabRef interesting as in every part of the program, one can improve something. :)\n\nJabRef 3.0 is the first effort to try to fix a lot of these issues. But with the available man-power we have at the moment, it is not feasible to keep all the existing features and fix/rewrite them so that we can maintain them again. We currently use three approaches: a) rewrite and put under test to improve quality and fix bugs, b) replace preference options with fixed values to reduce the number of available options, and c) remove features that have never worked or are extremely rarely used.\n\nRegarding the search functionality, we wanted to apply b and c. You applied a in your PR, but without the tests. I am open to rescue the search modes within an effort to reduce the overall complexity of the search and make it more usable. If you like, we can talk via a skype call regarding this. \n\nFor me, the most annoying this regarding search are:\n- local vs. global: in other applications, a local search within a file is normally completely separated from a global search. The global search is done in a separate window, see Sublime, Eclipse, IntelliJ, etc. whereas the local search is done within the file view. The results of the global search are also shown in a separate window wheres the ones in the local file are not. What is more, when having two databases open, and I issues a search query in one of them, and I switch to the other one, the search query is still displayed in the search window but not applied, creating even more confusion. \n- The options regex and case sensitive are hidden, but they are extremely relevant as the three elements (query, regex, case sensitive) decide which entries match and which do not. Hence, they should be always visible so that the user can easily \"debug\" why the results are shown this way. This is typical for IDEs as well, see sublime search etc.\n =||= Thanks @simonharrer for the explanations. They helped a lot in understanding your/the teams reasoning. You should add a few of these sentences to the wiki! \nI just want to add that one of the big selling points of Jabref is its customizability. There is probably no other reference manager with the same amount of preference options :). \n\nRegarding the search options: all the (main) open issues are ui-problems, right? So wouldn't it be a better strategy to wait with further modifications of the search until we have a new ui concept for Jabref? \n =||= Hm, good points. Will do that. \n\nRegarding customizability, this is an interesting point. We should discuss this in the next dev-call as well. \n\nRegarding the search options: yes, you are right, but we do not know how long the port to JavaFX will take. So we have to decide in that trade-off. Something for the dev-call, maybe.\n\nThank you for the comment.\n =||= @tobiasdiez have a look at the current results of the search-improvements branch. I adapted your code and created a search ui per tab, making it local to each database with an option to do a global search as well. \n =||= Good work! A few remarks:\n- now in filter and float mode the search happens after every text change. This should work in most cases and is an useful default. Did you tried it also with very large databases? I could imagine that in such cases the search is too slow to trigger it after with every text change. \n- all the icons are wrong (probably wrong font?)\n- the search settings popup is not connected to the button\n- do you really think that all this control buttons for regex / case sensitive are really so important to be shown that dominantly? I never changed these options and would trust Jabref with sensible default values. The same applies essentially to all of the controls you added. For me, most of these different possibilities are nice-to-have but i rarely change or need them (e.g. global search and results in dialog). Most of the times I do Ctrl + F -> type author or keyword -> look at results. But maybe this is just me.\n  So for the UI, I'm an advocate of clean and minimalistic interfaces. But since this is a UI change, I stop to have strong opinions about this for now and begin arguing again when we discuss UI issues next year *_promise :) *_\n- Ok, on UI thing: could you please set the background of the new search toolbar to white?\n =||= Help! I cannot close the \"settings\" pop up :cry: \n\nYou removed the \"toggle search bar\" option completely - so it should not be possible to close the search bar?\n\nApart from this: Awesome! \n\n@tobiasdiez  Simon already posted an explanation regarding case sensitivity and regex above:\n\n> The options regex and case sensitive are hidden, but they are extremely relevant as the three elements (query, regex, case sensitive) decide which entries match and which do not. Hence, they should be always visible so that the user can easily \"debug\" why the results are shown this way.

Microsoft Office, Google, Windows, Firefox as well as all music and reference library manager I looked at just show a search field without any settings buttons. If we focus on power users than it is ok to show these buttons (since then the target audience should be similar to the one of code editors). But if we want to provide a reference manager for everybody (not even necessarily Latex users), then we should orient ourselves at the usual office programs. But this is a discussion which we should have before changing ui things...\n\nAt least I would like to have an option to show/hide all these buttons. I also welcome an option to toggle between my minimalistic and your more elaborate approach. (regarding \"we have to many configuration options\", you may have a look at the motivation for creating the Vivaldi browser)\n\n+1 for the little \"x\"\n =||= At least Firefox has a \"case sensitive\" option ;-)\n\nI see your point, but the difference between the MS Office and the other searches is: MS Office only provides a \"dumb\" feature which is not configurable - if you provide some configurations, the settings affecting the search result should be displayed - and if shown as \"toggle buttons\" it is also easy to change them afterwards without the need of opening a popup menu.\n\n> I also welcome an option to toggle between my minimalistic and your more elaborate approach. \n\nThis would be a valid option yes!\n\nHowever, I think we should use our time for more crucial discussions ;-)\n =||= Implemented your suggestions except the X within the search field - this is quite complicated to do with a lot of UI hacks. I could offer a clear button if this is really required. \n =||= Ok, please have a look at the current version of #332 which is good to go from my point of view. \n =||= @simonharrer  and  @tobiasdiez  commented on Nov 11 2015 about \n\n>  remove incremental search\n\nI was running an older JabRef version that had search in the LHS panel, but now it is in the Tab and I can't find where to turn off incremental search. This is a major PIA, because I have a very large .bib file and the incremental search messes up typing in the search field because of the lag as it incrementally searches 45Mb.\n\nAm I not seeing the setting, or has it VERY UNFORTUNATELY been removed as the post seem to say?  Should I request it be reinstated as a feature request? Incremental ON makes searching very frustrating. Can I set in manually OFF in a config file?\n =||= Yes, as far as I know the incremental search was removed.\nHowever, I think, you mean something different. Incremental was a search mode, which jumpened from one hit to the next one, similar to how the search feature works in mayor browsers. On the other hand, your problems seems to be that JabRef searches as soon as the input in the search field is varied. I am not aware of an option to disable this automatic search but can understand that it might be a problem for very big databases. Can you please open an new issue for it.

Some of the formatters should be a) integrated as default auto formatters b) removed because they really don't make a lot of sense.\n4. Most license problems are caused by these classes.\n# List\n\n> - **Authors** : this formatter provides formatting options for the author and editor fields; for detailed information, see below. It deprecates a range of dedicated formatters provided in versions of JabRef prior to 2.7.\n> - **CreateBibORDFAuthors** : formats authors for according to the requirements of the Bibliographic Ontology (bibo).\n> - **CreateDocBookAuthors** : formats the author field in DocBook style.\n> - **CreateDocBookEditors** : formats the editor field in DocBook style.\n> - **CurrentDate**: outputs the current date. With no argument, this formatter outputs the current date and time in the format \"yyyy.MM.dd hh:mm:ss z\" (date, time and time zone). By giving a different format string as argument, the date format can be customized. E.g. \\format[CurrentDate]{yyyy.MM.dd} will give the date only, e.g. 2005.11.30.\n> - Default : takes a single argument, which serves as a default value. If the string to format is non-empty, it is output without changes. If it is empty, the default value is output. For instance, \\format[Default(unknown)]{\\year} will output the entry's year if set, and \"unknown\" if no year is set.\n> \n> **DOIStrip**: strips any prefixes from the DOI string.\n\nShould be automatically integrated as sensible default!\n\n> **DOICheck** : provides the full url for a DOI link.\n\nDOICheck as name makes no sense. Rename at least to DOILink.\n\n> - FileLink(filetype) : if no argument is given, this formatter outputs the first external file link encoded in the field. To work, the formatter must be supplied with the contents of the \"file\" field.\n>   This formatter takes the name of an external file type as an optional argument, specified in parentheses after the formatter name. For instance, \\format[FileLink(pdf)]{\\file} specifies pdf as an argument. When an argument is given, the formatter selects the first file link of the specified type. In the example, the path to the first PDF link will be output.\n> - FirstPage : returns the first page from the \"pages\" field, if set. For instance, if the pages field is set to \"345-360\" or \"345--360\", this formatter will return \"345\".\n> - FormatChars : This formatter converts LaTeX character sequences their equicalent unicode characters and removes other LaTeX commands without handling them.\n> - FormatPagesForHTML : replaces \"--\" with \"-\".\n> - FormatPagesForXML : replaces \"--\" with an XML en-dash.\n> - GetOpenOfficeType : returns the number used by the OpenOffice.org bibliography system (versions 1.x and 2.x) to denote the type of this entry.\n> - HTMLChars : replaces TeX-specific special characters (e.g. {^a} or {\\\"{o}}) with their HTML representations, and translates LaTeX commands \\emph, \\textit, \\textbf into HTML equivalents.\n> - HTMLParagraphs : interprets two consecutive newlines (e.g. \\n \\n) as the beginning of a new paragraph and creates paragraph-html-tags accordingly.\n> - IfPlural : outputs its first argument if the input field looks like an author list with two or more names, or its second argument otherwise. E.g. \\format[IfPlural(Eds.,Ed.)]{\\editor} will output \"Eds.\" if there is more than one editor, and \"Ed.\" if there is only one.\n> - JournalAbbreviator : The given input text is abbreviated according to the journal abbreviation lists. If no abbreviation for input is found (e.g. not in list or already abbreviated), the input will be returned unmodified. For instance, when using \\format[JournalAbbreviator]{\\journal}, \"Physical Review - Letters\" gets \"Phys. Rev. Lett.\"\n> - LastPage : returns the last page from the \"pages\" field, if set. For instance, if the pages field is set to \"345-360\" or \"345--360\", this formatter will return \"360\".\n> - NoSpaceBetweenAbbreviations : LayoutFormatter that removes the space between abbreviated First names. Example: J. R. R. Tolkien becomes J.R.R. Tolkien.\n> - NotFoundFormatter : Formatter used to signal that a formatter hasn't been found. This can be used for graceful degradation if a layout uses an undefined format.\n> - Number : outputs the 1-based sequence number of the current entry in the current export. This formatter can be used to make a numbered list of entries. The sequence number depends on the current entry's place in the current sort order, not on the number of calls to this formatter.\n> \n> **RemoveBrackets** : removes all curly brackets \"{\" or \"}\".\n\nThis just removes **all** brackets without checking for escape sequences or such, e.g. {.\n\n> **RemoveBracketsAddComma**: removes all curly brackets \"{\" or \"}\". The closing curly bracket is replaced by a comma.\n\nI don't see any use case where I want to do this.\n- RemoveLatexCommands : removes LaTeX commands like \\em, \\textbf, etc. If used together with HTMLChars or XMLChars, this formatter should be called last.\n\n> **RemoveTilde**: replaces the tilde character used in LaTeX as a non-breakable space by a regular space. Useful in combination with the NameFormatter discussed in the next section.\n> \n> **RemoveWhitespace**: removes all whitespace characters.\n\nWhere would this make any sense?\n\n> - Replace(regexp,replacewith) : does a regular expression replacement. To use this formatter, a two-part argument must be given. The parts are separated by a comma. To indicate the comma character, use an escape sequence: \\, \u00a0 The first part is the regular expression to search for. Remember that any commma character must be preceded by a backslash, and consequently a literal backslash must be written as a pair of backslashes. A description of Java regular expressions can be found at: \u00a0http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html \u00a0 The second part is the text to replace all matches with.\n> \n> **RisAuthors** : to be documented.\n> **RisKeywords** : to be documented.\n> **RisMonth** : to be documented.\n\n[Biblioscape](http://www.biblioscape.com/) formatter?\n\n> - RTFChars : replaces TeX-specific special characters (e.g. {^a} or {\\\"{o}}) with their RTF representations, and translates LaTeX commands \\emph, \\textit, \\textbf into RTF equivalents.\n> - ToLowerCase : turns all characters into lower case.\n> - ToUpperCase : turns all characters into upper case.\n> - WrapContent : This formatter outputs the input value after adding a prefix and a postfix, as long as the input value is non-empty. If the input value is empty, an empty string is output (the prefix and postfix are not output in this case). The formatter requires an argument containing the prefix and postix separated by a comma.

Since JabRef is written in Java, whatever we are extracting from it will also be Java.\r\n\r\nSo if you want to use such an extracted library, you would have to write a small Java wrapper that processes command line calls and invokes the library.

Without a blank line inbetween, it might get confusing.\n =||= @koppor: At this moment, the current approach for the field ordering seems fine to me. I do not mind a blank line and then an alphabetic restart. However, I would not like it if, for example, the (relatively long) \"Abstract\" comes before the \"author\", \"year\", etc. Apart from that, an alphabetic order has never been required by any *.bib-file processing code as far as I know (but my experience is too small to make a generically valid statement about that).\n =||= 4330d94044a4dbc1d4e035a2895dd0ca380452e4 removes the blank line between required and optional fields.\n\n@koppor: You can close the bug reports on source forge.

Dropping all field saving options (Preferences -> File -> Field saving options)\n- [x] Fields are sorted as stated in the Bibtex / Biblatex manuals.\n- [x] The `=` is appended directly to the field key. The `value` part is indented to one space past the longest field key name + `=` (so that all values are aligned).\n- [x] Bibtex entry keys are written in camel case, starting upper case\n- [x] Field keys are formatted in lower case only\n- [x] No longer perform any changes of field content (no more space/tab/newline elimination, etc.)\n- [x] Provide formatter (Example: Remove tabs / newlines / duplicate spaces) that can be enabled by a user for specific fields onLoad / onSave. These are not enabled by default.\n- [x] If in doubt, do as biber does", "1. We should **NOT** add compatibility patches. We want people to switch to JabRef 3.\n2. We should probably revert some changes to be more BibTeX conform. **We want to encourage usage of JabRef not plain editing and readability of bib files**.\n   -  Remove the blank line (see #115)\n   -  Revert capitalization of second word of BibTex type and just use the standard tag (to investigate)\n   -  Revert camel casing of field names\n\nDunno what `Configurable: Start field contents in same column. Enabled by default` means, yet.\n =||= JabRef is BibTeX conform. There are habits only :)\n\nI think, we should enable readability as the `.bib` files can be put under version control, compared, quickly edited, etc. Otherwise, we produce a kind of a binary format, which is hard to handle in version control systems (see versioned .docx documents).\n\nI tend to like the new format. We can discuss whether we remove the casing again. I got used to it, but no one else offers such a format.\n\nMaybe we should start a wiki page with all possible formats and vote on the preferred format and implement that.\n\n### Configuration options\n\nSee Options -> Preferences -> File -> \"Field saving options\"\n- Use camel case for field names\n- Start field contents in same column\n- Include empty fields\n- Wrap fields as ver 2.9.2\n- Field sorting options: alphabetic, unsorted, user-defined order\n\nFurthermore, one can configure the ordering of the entries: See \"Database properties\": Save as configured globally, original order, order as specified.\n\nShould we drop all these options and define \"the one and only\" serialization? What about being as minimal intrusive as possible? For instance, when a group of researchers uses different tools to manage their bibliographies?\n =||= Sharing a file while using a revision control software causes trouble if the Field saving options are not identical among users.\nHence, to facilitate sharing, I suggest to add in the See Options -> Preferences -> File -> \"Field saving options\" a \"master switch\" named something like \"Default sharing format\".  That way, to make sharing smooth, users will simply have to ensure this single switch is selected. \nI do not know which of the 5 above options should be selected/unselected by the \"Default sharing format\" switch, but I am sure that ensuring that everybody have the same settings among 5 options is going to be a pain.\n =||= Considering the configuration options you mentioned, Olly, i would suggest to remove (most of) them and just define one format for JabRef that suits our ideas and concept. This removes the problems that mlep described.\n =||= Well, \"one format [...] that suits our ideas and concept\", may not suit users... \nThese could be because of personal preferences or because of compatibility with other software. So, I would suggest to keep the possibility of various field saving options.\n =||= I think, this is the discussion GNOMEv2 vs. GNOMEv3, where they removed various configuration options. I see the following options:\n\nA) Remove all configuration options and introduce a \"one size fits all\" format\nB) Keep everything as is\nC) Add support for the old 2.9.2 format\n\nA) This increases testability (as less configuration combinations have to be tested) and eases sharing of BibTeX files across JabRef users.\nB) We still have to add test cases. - Side comment: At \"database properties\", one can add the file sorting options. We could add a button \"make database ready for sharing\" or, even better, set a suitable default JabRef configuration. As soon as the old version vanish (and the users have reset their preferences), additional configuration is only required for special cases\nC) This causes much effort (at least 20h) and is only because there are users not updating their software. Even [debian stable has JabRef v2.10](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/jabref).\n\nIn all cases, we should check whether [other BibTeX-based managers](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/wiki/Alternatives#bibtex-based) or compatible. We can also neglect them and assume that other BibTeX managers are used seldomly. The Microsoft Office way ^^.\n =||= I agree with you all, there is no _wrong_ or _right_ here. My main argument is that \n- configuration makes usage difficult as you **have to know how** to configure and that there is a configuration option for certain features\n- makes portability problematic as there might be **a lot of different** user configurations\n- is a **threat** to testing and stability because of various possible states of configuration\n\nTherefore my personal principles\n- should only be used if there is a **real** benefit by this configuration option\n- the good old **convention over configuration** concept really condenses my personal favors. \n =||= To me, C) should not be implemented. When a new version (of a freely available software) is released, it is the responsibility of the user if he/she want to use the old version.\nBetween A and B, I favor B: if the default settings are the best for sharing, it is the responsibility of the user to use another configuration. And to report a bug if he/she find one (so, the user does the testing ;-) )\n =||= Regarding C), I get more bug reports than usual, which is an indicator that it is important for our users. See [sf feature request #864](https://sourceforge.net/p/jabref/feature-requests/864/) and related bugs. I can be the bad guy and just say \"We don't have resources for that. If someone volunteers, we will include the patch.\". Or we could collect donations for it. Or we should put it in the survey as option for next development (what we currently have)?\n\n[FLOSS COACH says](http://www.flosscoach.com/index.php/my-coach/jabref): \"some people are direct, critical or seem to be rude.\"  :sunglasses:\n =||= Well, if C) is a feature requested by user, I guess it should be kept...\nAnd if the main contributors to JabRef do not have time to do it, I do not see anything bad about asking the community for a volunteer. \n =||= I'll throw in my hat for option A.\n\nFrom my point of view, JabRef has gotten so complex and ill-structured that there's a considerable risk that it will die because no one can maintain or extend it anymore. Following this logic, anything that reduces complexity, even if we lose features, is desirable.\n =||= Regarding A). If we follow that, we should use the sort order given by the biblatex manual (Sections 2.1.1 and 2.1.2). We should also go back to field names written in lowercase letters. OK, this sort odering is also not always optimal: in `incollection`, the `introduction` comes before `subtitle`. Nevertheless, the current serialization is strange in the case of `article`: The `number` comes before `volume` and inbetween, there is `pages`.\n =||= Regarding the field ordering, I guess [the btxdoc reference available here](https://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/biblio/bibtex/base?lang=de) is the ultimate source. Sect. 3.1, p. 8, states that _\"The  fields within each class (required or optional) are listed in order of occurrence in the output, except that a few entry types may perturb the order slightly, depending on  what  fields  are  missing.\"_ \n\nHence, I would suggest that we hard code the order defined in the manual (easy, can be done during the definition of bibtex entries). Unknown fields can be sorted alphabetically after known fields. Btw.: where do entry types, such as \"patent\" or \"periodical\" come from?\n =||= I am also for **A)**. The reason i made some of the options configurable was to support old use of JabRef and keep the option to decide if such \"_pretty_\" formatting would eventually be accepted.\n\nI am using VCS for bibliographies and papers and I also share bibliographies between papers, e.g. using GIT modules. Therefore a unified \"_pretty_\" formatting always contributed to orientation in a BibTeX files and effectiveness during changes. I would be definitely against some binary-like serialization. BibTeX is a plain/text file and should be IMHO also readable using other tools, supporting  text-view only, e.g. Overleaf (where such formatting also contributes to better orientation especially in huge BibTeX files).\n\nAFAIK camel-case is not a problem in BibTeX but contributes to readability.\n\nSorting: `title` first, `required fields`, `optional fields`, `other fields`, grouped and separated with an empty line helps to understand the BibTeX structure when viewed in plain text. Fixed sorting in groups (alphabetically) also contributes to orientation and less conflicts during changes in VCS.\n\nIf the order has some compatibility issues, as **Lenhard** said, or some rules are saying that, e.g., `volume` should come before `number`, then I would also be for making fix (hard-coded) ordering of `required` and `optional fields`. But I would still keep alphabetical order of `other fields` and spaces between the groups and CamelCase.\n\nMy suggestion would be to remove as much as possible configuration elements and keep only those which are necessary (in my opinion none of those regarding formatting are). Maybe enable some \"_advanced_\" mode where some configuration is possible. Fix serialization supporting as much as possible readable BibTeX source.\n\nBackwards compatibility regarding this issue is in my opinion not necessary. New version can still read files produced by old versions and vice-versa. New version produces new formatting, old version old formatting. The user can decide which version (s)he will use. If used along with VCS than the will be one commit with the \"_JabRef upgrade_\" comment :-) And from that point new commits will be \"_pretty_\".\n =||= @lenhard:  About \"patent\" and \"periodical\" (but also \"standard\" and \"electronic\"), I believe they come from IEEE. See http://mirror.ibcp.fr/pub/CTAN/macros/latex/contrib/IEEEtran/bibtex/IEEEtran_bst_HOWTO.pdf\n =||= I think we are nearning a consensus :-) We will decide the issue during the next developer conference call.\n\nI largely agree with @kubovy maybe expect for:\n- When it comes to camel casing of field names, I would rather stick to the bibtex manual as close as possible\n- The empty space between required/optional/other fields has been removed in #115 \n\n@mlep: Thanks! We can use that guide as a reference to fix the field ordering as well.\n =||= http://www.bibtex.org/Format/ they use for example: @STRING and @string -> it is case **insensitive**. IMHO camel-case formatting is just about how it appears to the human eye. Also there is this example:\n\n```\n@article{mrx05, \n    auTHor = \"Mr. X\", \n    Title = {Something Great}, \n    publisher = \"nob\" # \"ody\", \n    YEAR = 2005, \n} \n```\n =||= Sorry for a late instep, but what about biblatex?\n =||= @bluebirch: I'd say we treat biblatex in the same fashion as bibtex. Code-wise, this should make no difference. In JabRef's model, a biblatex entry is also a `BibtexEntry`. Sorting of fields can be taken from the [the biblatex manual](http://ftp.uni-erlangen.de/ctan/macros/latex/contrib/biblatex/doc/biblatex.pdf).\n\n@kubovy: The parser should be able to parse the camel casing (I should write a test). The idea is to remove it when writing back the file.\n =||= @lenhard: Totally agree. Fully satisfied with that answer. ;-)\n =||= Since we were discussing the serialization format in a wider public in this issue, I'd like to document our decisions from yesterday's conference call here:\n\nRationale: People are very emotional about formatting -> Modify as little as possible in the bib file\n\nFor the concrete checks, see the initial post.\n =||= Nice!\nHave you talked about some default settings for collaborative work using a VCS?\n =||= What do you mean by default settings? By removing all configuration options, we are VCS ready. The only thing what was difficult to decide is regarding \"New entries are added to the bottom of the file\". This will really cause issues when two collaborators are adding entries. The decision was that we cannot assume a particular order of the entries in the bibtex file. And if we add something after the first match, that could be wrong. First match is something like: First place of bibtex key or first place when considering sorting according to author, title, year. For instance, existing keys: `a`, `d`, `f`, `c`., new key `b` would be added after `a`, even the list was not sorted.\n =||= I was thinking about a way of ensuring all users have the same settings for the formatters (for example) when a file is used for collaborative work.\nThis could be set by a dedicated file property. If set, JabRef will use the default formatters (and not the user configuration). Just an idea. \n =||= @mlep There won't be any configuration settings any more. Nothing more to worry about different settings. This also makes  #180 obsolete.\n =||= > -  Fixed and non-configurable format (dropping several configuration options) for new or modified entries. Fields are sorted as stated in the Bibtex / Biblatex manuals. the = value part is indented to one space past the longest field key name (so that all values are aligned).\n\nOkay - Olly was faster ;-) \n\nSo the only requirement is: all users should use the same (new) JabRef version.\n =||= @koppor & @matthiasgeiger :\nFrom a previous discussion, I understood that we will not have any settings for the file content.\nBut in this thread, I read: \n\n> Provide formatter (Example: Remove tabs / newlines / duplicate spaces) that can be enabled by a user for specific fields onLoad / onSave. These are not enabled by default.\n\nWhat if the user does not use the default formatter settings?

Either, because I want to paste a reference in a review, I work with Microsoft Word managing the references by hand, or I just quickly send around a reference to users not using BibTeX as serialization format. Currently, JabRef cannot be configured quickly to render Springer or IEEE styled entries: One has to use a combination of HTML and the formatters to get the desired result.\n\n[CitationStyles](http://citationstyles.org/) is the new way to offer rendering of bibliographic data. Currently JabRef offers following two possibilities to format BibTeX entries\n- Through [JabRef's formatters](http://jabref.sourceforge.net/help/CustomExports.php), which are used at the export or at the preview panel\n- Through bibtex (`bst`) and biblatex ([biblatex-styles](https://de.sharelatex.com/learn/Biblatex_citation_styles)) - when using in a latex document\n\nI am aware that another options causes more trouble.

After finishing the edit the whole edit is reverted using Ctrl-Z.\nPeople who do not use the shortcut are only able to undo whole edits. \n =||= I think, I went through the same thinkings:\nA) Consistency with other programs (CTRL+z and menu action always the same behavior)\nB) \"intuitive\" use of CTRL+z\n\n:+1: for keeping as-is: A rewrite that the global action behaves like the CTRL+z action causes too much effort.\n =||= @JabRef/developers Will we ever work on this or should we close it as a reference.\n =||= We probably should, but we probably won't :-)\n\nThere is simply too much work to be done and so far no real user has complained about this.\n =||= Can we tag it as unimportant?

I will take this opportunity to clean up my preferences then \u2026 :wink: \n =||= @matthiasgeiger I would set my preferences manually, if it would work. But unfortunately, I can not change any preferences except the language setting. As I said, whenever I click on OK in the preferences pane, nothing happens. This is also the case with version 2.11b3, which had worked before. Any hints?\n =||= Ahh... that is crap :disappointed: \n\nUnfortunately we cannot reproduce this issue as no one of the current developers is using a Mac. \n\nA weird workaround might be to use v2.10 to set the preferences which than can be used in v2.11bX\n =||= @domwass Could you start it using the terminal and `java -jar`? Then we might see some exceptions popping up. Alternatively, you could open \"Help\" -> \"Show Errror Console\" and then have a look at the Exceptions tab.\n =||= @matthiasgeiger I will try v2.10 later.\n@koppor Error console says:\n\n```\nException in thread \"AWT-EventQueue-0\" java.lang.NullPointerException\nat net.sf.jabref.AdvancedTab.storeSettings(Unknown Source)\nat net.sf.jabref.PrefsDialog3$OkAction$1.run(Unknown Source)\nat sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)\nat sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:39)\nat sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:25)\nat java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:597)\nat spin.Invocation.evaluate(Invocation.java:175)\nat spin.off.SpinOffEvaluator$1.run(SpinOffEvaluator.java:108)\nat java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:695)\n```\n =||= Okay... I think I got it. \n\nThere is no \"default look and feel\" set for Mac OSX, therefore the (not visible for Mac OS X) dropdown box in the AdvancedTab of the Preferences for selecting the LookAndFeel is empty and the NullPointerException is caused by the `toString()` call in `preferences.put(JabRefPreferences.WIN_LOOK_AND_FEEL, className.getSelectedItem().toString());`\n\nWhat is the lookAndFeel to be used on a mac? \n`UIManager.getSystemLookAndFeelClassName()` or `UIManager.getCrossPlatformLookAndFeelClassName()` (== metal)? \n =||= I just added `UIManager.getSystemLookAndFeelClassName()` as the default value in the prefs.\n\n@domwass It would be great if you would check whether this solves the problem using this snapshot build: https://circle-artifacts.com/gh/JabRef/jabref/655/artifacts/0/home/ubuntu/jabref/build/releases/JabRef-2.80dev--snapshot--2015-10-08--2da8161-OSX.zip\n =||= Yes, this works \u2013 thanks. I can now change the preferences \u2013 and it also works in 2.11b3 again. \n\nAnother problem that I encountered using the snapshot, though: I enabled the biblatex mode and left everything else as is. After closing and re-opening JabRef, the table is blank (white), although the data is there. (I attached a screenshot.) With 2.11b3 everything is fine.\n![biblatex-mode](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2708770/10366945/d5ba039a-6dcd-11e5-9366-e4a5d9cf2ca4.jpg)\n =||= @matthiasgeiger Can you backport your fix to 2.11 with reasonable effort? Trying to close the last issues for 2.11 final release on 10/31/15.\n =||= Yeah, should be possible.\n =||= Merged into master (https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/commit/7d07e3921fcae5326744de1152e67e88895055aa) and backported to dev2.11 in https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/commit/11d486cf477d39261a7375cb9854b8b1bb73e158.\n =||= @domwass The build can be retrieved from http://ge.tt/9Idc446\n =||= @koppor Thanks, I just did a quick test and it seems to work.\n =||= Glad to here ;-) \nSo let's try to close this issue again...\n =||= "], ["150", "Removes the legacy-action Integrity Check", "Simon Harrer", "simonharrer", "10/29/15, 02:50:22 PM", "Removes the **legacy**-action `Tools--> Legacy Tools... --> Integrity Check` with all its files. \n\nWhat it helps:\n- removes 1000 lines of code\n- removes a feature that is marked as a legacy tool\n\nWhat does the feature do at the moment:\n- check year: raise error if it contains a 4digit number\n- check title: warn only about wrong braces\n- check author/editor: check that the structure is correct using `and` and the `,` separator.\n\nAnyone who wants this feature to stay?\n\nIs there any other validation facility in place where we could add the checks instead?", "Wow, the features look impressive!\n\nDoes it check for presence or absence of 4 digit year number? I think, presence of 4 digits makes sense?\n\nWrong braces: Maybe we should have two modes for a bibtex file - collecting and paper writing (see  #113). And for paper writing, we should have some brace check. In the collecting mode, no braces should be used at all.\n\nAuthor/editor check: What a useful tool. I'm always struggling with that.\n\nWe should keep these checks! The checks should be **moved** to the fields: If a field looses the focus, the check should be fired. If the field is wrong, the field should be colored in red.\n =||= Is there already a similar check for another field in place? Or should we\njust Mark the Entry red in the table as when there is something missing?\n =||= At least the BibTex-Key is currently checked (e.g., spaces are not allowed).\n =||= There is already a related feature discussion here: #131 \n =||= I even didn't know the check for the BibTex key. JabRef really insists on correct BibTeX keys there...\n\nAn entry as a whole is marked in red if something is wrong: The number in the first column gets a red background. I suppose, it is only marked if a required field is missing. In the case of `article` additionally, if `volume` and `pages` is missing. But there is no fly-over-help at the red number :worried:\n =||= Hm, this is a lot of effort to put a system in place which can handle such checks and validations in a sensible way. \n\nMaybe we can leverage the tool tip text that is set in the IncompleteRenderer. But I cannot see the tool tip text in JabRef ...\n =||= Is it an aspect for #113? Maybe we should close this pull request and add a new issue to implement the checking behavior. JabRef should support the user whenever possible :smiley:\n =||= Large UPDATE:\n- [x] refactored existing integrity checks and provide test cases for them\n- [x] instead of complex GUI elements, use a simple results table for displaying the validation results\n- [x] instead of having separate language property files for a few keys, use the default ones\n- [x] minimal but working example of such a validation\n\nI propose to merge this as this has more value than the \"legacy\" implementation before. \n =||= Great, that this integrity message resource properties are gone now ;-) \n\nAnd for the first time this feature seems to work :wink:\n\nNot sure how much time it requires to implement, but a nice feature would be to open the affected entry and setting the cursor in the affected field when selecting a found integrity issue. \n\nAnother minor aspect: the results table currently wastes a lot of space for the affected field but the message is not completely readible.\n =||= Good ideas. But I think the current state is good enough to have a usable and helpful feature.\n =||= I think the aspects above are rather crucial for good usability - I will check how easy this can be implemented...\n =||= Done. :metal:\n =||= :trophy: awesome. \n =||= Bug: when the field for which the validation files is not required, the field is not found. \n\nExample: title has an error, but the entry is of type Misc and only requires a bibtex key. \n =||= Fixed in f9ea1d1fe1dd5d01457fecfabbfe522da9e4cfd3\n =||= "], ["151", "Upgraded to windows 10: Bibsonomy plug-in failure", null, "ideutsch", "09/10/15, 07:05:14 AM", "I upgraded my OS from Windows 7 to Windows 10 recently, and the JabRef does not allow me to add new entries or even edit existing entries.

I really dislike the inconsistency between them: `UTF8` has no `-`, but `UTF-16` has: Both should have a dash resulting in `UTF-8`. (see https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8)\n-  `Cp1251` should be `CP1251` (see http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/cp1251.7.html for example).

Similar for all other encodings\n\nOn the one hand, I am very well aware that a change here results in a large compatibility code where the old strings have to be mapped to the new strings. On the other hand, I would like to see JabRef having strings not causing confusion.\n\nRelated: #118, #131 ", "I fully agree with what you write and just had a look at this issue.\n\nAs far as I can see, we can just replace the faulty names with the correct ones in `ALL_ENCODINGS` and add the correct names to `ENCODING_NAMES_LOOKUP`. This means we have two keys (the correct name and the old name) for the same encoding. This should not break anything, since `ALL_ENCODINGS` is only used to display available encoding names in the UI and `ENCODING_NAMES_LOOKUP` is used for for actually applying an encoding. Hence, duplicate keys won't hurt as long as the values are ok (which, I assume, they are).\n\nTo sum up: This change looks pretty easy to me, but perhaps I just overlooked a difficult problem.

Did we change the resolution of these strings from b3 to b4? I don't know if we need these strings in `JabRef_*.properties` at all. I would vote for removing them completely there.\n\nExcerpt of result of `grep -r \"Save_selected_as\" .` in `jabref-dev_2.11/src/main/resources/resource`\n\n```\n./JabRef_pt_BR.properties:Save_selected_as_...=Salvar_selecionados_como...\n./JabRef_pt_BR.properties:Save_selected_as_plain_BibTeX_...=Salvar_selecionado_como_Bibtex_simples\n./Menu_pt_BR.properties:Save_selected_as_...=Salvar_os_se&lecionados_como...\n```\n\nI can do the merging into the master branch and resolving the conflicts...\n\n(Pro hint: [have two checkouts at the same time](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree))\n =||= The displayed menu text is not translated in 2.11b3 as there is no \"Save_selected_as_plain_BibTeX_...\" key in the `Menu_*.properties`. \nThe key is present in the `JabRef_*.properties` and this key is used to translate the tooltip popping up when hovering over the menu title. \n\n(This is one weak point in the current localization: there are various strings which have to be maintained in two places:  `Menu_*.properties` and `JabRef_*.properties`)\n\nBut I have not seen, that the exactly same key is used for both translations so I will simply copy the ones from `JabRef_*.properties` to  `Menu_*.properties` (both in `master` and `dev_2.11`).\n =||= Would it make sense to have only a single properties file for all of the translations?\n =||= Generally yes. \n\nTwo drawbacks: \n1) For new translators a relatively small `Menu_XX.properties` files is a good starting point and not so daunting as the 2500+ lines `JabRef_xx.properties`.\n2) Although the Strings for Menu and JabRef are almost equal, there is some special handling of Menu Strings as they might contain `&` for indicating Mnemonic keys. So there must be a solution to display the values correctly for menu and \"normal\" usage.\n =||= I agree with @matthiasgeiger and I can add more on this:\nI do not think this is advisable for very practical reasons: when a new potential translator shows up, the menu_XX.properties is relatively short, you can easily see the results, and you get all the menus translated in the short term. So, it is an easy task, and you get rewarded soon. For motivation, this is a clear plus.\nIf we merge menu_XX.properties and JabRef_XX.properties, I am afraid it will discourage most candidates, and also it will be difficult to start by translating all the menu.\nIf there is a need to merge both files, I guess the option is to identify the strings related to the menus (for example, \"Save_as...=Save_as...\" could be changed into \"MenuJabref_Save_as...=Save_as...\"), so that we can tell translators \"OK, the file is quite large, but do not be afraid: if you only do the strings starting with MenuJabref, it will be an easy and significant step forward.\n =||= Ok, then we should keep it as it is. \n =||= @koppor This can be closed as you merged the translations back to master in 88a5cc3706e03f50977aae17515660cec247abb8?\n =||= "], ["160", "Support of different type of BibTeX files", "Oliver Kopp", "koppor", "05/26/16, 06:49:31 AM", "We need two types of BibTeX files: One for collecting (BC) and one for working in tex files (BW).\n\nBC: This file is UTF-8 without encoded umlauts, without additional braces.\n\nBW: This file should have all characters encoded using LaTeX directives and containing only the fields required by the publisher. E.g., no review field, series only in the short form, abbreviated journal name, no DOI, ...

That effort should be reduced by JabRef.", "I think JabRef should keep working with the maximally informative format (BC) to retain as much information as possible for storage. Ideally I think it is the responsibility of the style file to get rid of any unwanted fields. UTF is not necessarily a problem either, if using bibtex8 or Biblatex.

So in this case, no (BW) file is necessary at all. For the bibtex users, I would suggest the following workflow (which needs some additional features in JabRef):\n1. Run latex on your document.\n2. Create a new (BW) file based on (BC) and the aux-file. (Not implemented in JabRef I think)\n3. Run a cleanup on the new (BW) file.

The cleanup operations have been improved in the meanwhile so that it is relatively easy to convert a BC file to a BW one. Moreover, the consensus above was that JabRef should focus on supporting the BC format.\n =||= I'd rather like to put it \"on-hold\", as sometimes one wants to have complete entries with volume and series, which one doesn't want in the final bib file.

(Except the clean commit history )\n\nThe changes include:\n- Search bar is now at the top\n- Autocompletion suggestions are shown in a popup\n- Search options are available via a drop-down list, this implements Feature Request #853\n- \"Clear search\" button also clears search field, this implements Feature Request #601\n- In incremental search mode: next result is selected by pressing enter (instead of Control + F as previously)\n- Incremental search now uses the same search engine as the other search modes\n- Added a new search mode (Live filter) which filters the table as soon as the search text is changed\n\nI have a few questions:\n- ~~There are quite a few changes from formatting the code in Eclipse. Is it ok if I include them?~~\n- I have a problem with listening to changes in the textfield and programatically setting the text with setText(). The latter command triggers first an event for the deletion of the text and then another one for inserting the new one. Is there a way to be informed just once about such a change? (This occours in the following case: if the user accepts an autocompletion, then the text is changed via setText(). Thus, in incremental and live filter mode, two searches are performed.)\n- ~~The SearchWorker implemented the AbstractWorker interface. As far as I understood, this enables one to do work asynchronously and then change the GUI later. However, the worker is simply run via \n      worker.getWorker().run();\n      worker.getCallBack().update();\n  In my understanding, this defeats completely the purpose of using the AbstractWorker. What is the right way to run it?~~\n- ~~A general observation about the `SearchRule` class. Every method of it takes the query as an argument. I would propose to save the query internally in  `SearchRule` and thus simplify the interface a little bit.~~\n- ~~The setting \"Autocomplete names\" is not yet implemented. In my opinion this can be completely removed.~~\n- ~~The setting \"Select matches\" is not yet implemented since I do not understand the purpose of this setting. Should it control whatever the first match is selected after the search is performed? Moreover, I think it was not implemented in the old search pane.~~\n\nThings which should be done at some point (I will open a ticket after this pull request was accepted):\n- All the other inline autocompletions (in fields for example) should also use the new dropdown style autocompleter\n- Search result table is not styled the same as main table, related [SF Bug 847](http://sourceforge.net/p/jabref/bugs/847/)", "Regarding new eclipse formatting rules: for me it is very hard to review the patch because there are too many lines that have been changed because of the change in formatting rules. This makes it very hard to determine which lines do actually have changed. I would propose that eclipse formatter changes should be done in isolation in separate pull requests. \n =||= I completely understand this. Now there is a second pull request #166 just containing the format/cleanup changes. Is this enough to make comparison easier or should I somehow also modify this PR?\n =||= The thing is that when I want to know what happened in a pull request, I look at https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/162/files which in this case is +2000 lines and -2000 lines at the moment. A lot of these lines were just reformatted, e.g., all the changes in the SearchManagerNoGUI. When the PR is small, formatting changes are no problem, but in this case it would help if this PR would only contain the functional changes, if this is possible without reprogramming everything. \n\nRegarding the thing with the AbstractWorker and the run/update method. This is correct as it is because in the constructor of the AbstractWorker a bit of MAGIC (it is really a lot of magic) happens so that when you invoke the run method, it will run ouside the Swing EDT and the update method will run inside the Swing EDT. \n\nRegarding the SearchRule: At the moment the search rule can be configured during its constructor and then invoked with different queries to allow reuse of the configuration done by the user in the GUI. At the moment the configuration mainly consists of [bool caseSensitive, bool regex]. But this model does not fit that well. I think it would be a good idea to just create test Predicates that receive a BibtexEntry and they can determine whether it will be included in the search or not. \n\nI think we can delete \"Select matches\". I do not see any usefulness in this setting, especially as it has not yet been implemented. \n\n\"Autocomplete Names\" does work on my machine. We should not remove it. \n =||= We do not want to loose all the work you did. Can you rebase on master? I will try to have a look at all the changes. \n\nAnother remark: why not make the live option the only one search mode and removing the explicit search button? For me, this is the typical search behavior in most of the applications I know. Even windows search. \n =||= I will try to rebase on master at the weekend.\nWhat should I do with the settings \"Autocomplete names\" and \"Select matches\" (see above)?\n =||= The rebase run into problems since some files were moved (for example BasePanel.java).

Then do a new commit. I hope that this commit has clean changes and is readable. Then you can do a `git push -f origin:uisearch` to overwrite the `uisearch` branch with the clean commits. Would that be possible? Then you can also reset your original branch to the new origin/uisearch. If something goes wrong, you still have a copy locally where you can compare using [KDiff3](http://kdiff3.sourceforge.net/) etc. (For the record, there are [many good diff tools](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/572237/whats-the-best-three-way-merge-tool)).\n =||= @matthiasgeiger and myself checked the new search UI and we liked it. Especially the live feature! :)\n\nWe are currently discussing to simplify the search altogether in #104. Maybe we can combine a few things. May be you can have a look at this issue as well and we can work something out for integrate these ideas in your PR as well. \n =||= @koppor I opened a second, cleaner PR #307 (I don't want to override my branch). I hope this is also ok.\n\n@simonharrer I had a look on the discussion in #104 while implementing this PR. Indeed, some of the design decision were strongly influenced by this thread. On the other hand, some of the motivations for the suggested changes in #104 do no longer apply to the search control at the top of the window (in contrast to the previous implementation as a side control). For example, the size of the dropdown showing the different search options is not very important so that is now no problem to show all the search options as a list.\nTo be honest, I would prefer if you could accept this PR and we discuss further improvements later.

I've forked to my GitHub-account, got a copy of that on to my laptop but the reverse process may take a bit more time to figure out... :-)\n\nAnyway, I've improved this a bit, with more words that shouldn't be capitalized, but the problem is that there isn't a single way to write title case. Especially, some publishers (APA and IEEE at least) capitalize all words with more than three characters (basically, I guess, to avoid the confusion that some words are sometimes prepositions, which shouldn't be capitalized, sometimes major words, which should). How do you recon we should go about with that? Have two different TitleCaseChangers?\n\nIn addition, I made sure that words within curly brackets are kept as is for all CaseChangers.\n\nThe things that remain are making sure that the first word after \":\" is capitalized and that both parts of a hyphenated word is capitalized (such as \"First-Time GitHub-User\").\n =||= Great!\n[Here is a link to the official GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/proposing-changes-to-a-project-with-pull-requests/) regarding \"Pull-Requests\" which is the standard GitHub way to contribute to JabRef after you have pushed the changes to your fork. \nWe will review your work and can than merge it into the project codebase.\nIf you should have any questions or trouble just contact us!\n =||= The other page is https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/ (which is also in our CONTRIBUTING.md).

Replacing a default abbreviation with a personal one should not result in a duplicate warning. Is this what you mean?\n =||= Not exactly. I find that if you create a new abbreviation, not present in the default list, the program warns about a duplicate.\nIn the example above I created an abbreviation for the fake journal \"Test Journal of Motorcycle Repair\", which is **not** in the default list, but only in the personal list. JabRef then warns that it's a duplicate:\n\n```\nDuplicate Journal Abbreviation - old one will be overwritten by new one\nOLD: Abbreviation{name=Test Journal of Motorcycle Repair, iso=Test J. Mot. Rep., medline=Test J Mot Rep}\nNEW: Abbreviation{name=Test Journal of Motorcycle Repair, iso=Test J. Mot.

So, in that case the warnings make sense.\n =||= I have implemented a fix for the first part of the issue. For the second part, I do not know what to do. Maybe we should change the log statements to debug so that they are not shown to the user?\n =||= An option might be to extract the IEEE journals abbreviations from journalList.txt and creating a third list with the \"plain\" IEEE journals abbreviations. Then if USE_IEEE_ABRV is **not** set the \"plain\" list is loaded, otherwise the \"LaTeX abbreviations\" in IEEEJournalList.txt is loaded (and a single line warning is sent to output).\nWill this also speed up the startup avoiding the duplicate check?\n =||= Good thinking. This might be an easy way to solve these issues while speeding up startup time. Especially not having all this console output will speed up the start as this is an expensive IO action. The check itself should be very fast and not that problematic.\n =||= Any comments from your side, @ambro2 ? Otherwise I will close this issue. \n =||= I haven't had any chance to test the branch.

When users with different configuration options check in their `.bib` file into version control, the files have textual diffeences without any content difference.\n\nI propose that JabRef writes its serialization settings into the bibtex file at each save. This ensures that the serialization options are always met. The other option is that JabRef asks the user whether he wants to prepare the `.bib` file for sharing. If not, JabRef stores the filename in its preferences and never asks the user again.\n\nThis covers at least\n- entry sorting (alphabetically using the author, sorting by the bibtex key, or no sorting, just adding entries at the end)\n- format of each entry (see #116)\n## Related discussions\n- This issue is closely related to the discussion going on at #116 - especially https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/116#issuecomment-133311604.\n- https://sourceforge.net/p/jabref/feature-requests/892/\n- https://sourceforge.net/p/jabref/feature-requests/854/", "But then the file contains text that is not bibtex and probably not in bibtex syntax.

Currently, there are three different styles for ordering the serialization. If your preferences differ between your machines, maybe different styles are selected, resulting in a different output. Did you recently reset preferences?\n\nAs things stand, this is no bug or issue, but the design of jabref. I am very much for using only one serialization format and disallowing customizations, which would fix all this. But from what I can tell, customization is desired.\n =||= I was only referring to the contents _within_ `jabref-entrytype: Collection: opt`. I went through the code and couldn't see any change of the ordering of the optional fields. This also cannot be configured, therefore I doubt, it has anything to do with the reset of my preferences (#132).\n\nDid not want to open a general discussion as #116. :innocent: \n =||= I think, it has to do with different java versions: `Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_60-b27)` seems to order alphabetically, whereas `build 1.8.0_51-b16` seems to reverse the last two.\n =||= What? :frowning:\n =||= @koppor: can you determine which sorting style you use (which of the writing methods get called in BibtexEntryWriter)?\n\nSorting is done via calling [Collection.sort()](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Collections.html#sort-java.util.List-) with a `List<String>`. For some fields it is done via putting them in a [TreeSet](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/TreeSet.html). Regardless of the method, the order should be the same. It is hard to believe that the JVM suddendly sorts Strings from z-a and not from a-z.\n\nSee the following code from BibtexEntryWriter:\n\n``` java\n    private void writeRequiredFieldsFirstOptionalFieldsSecondRemainingFieldsThird(BibtexEntry entry, Writer out) throws IOException {\n        // Write header with type and bibtex-key.\n        out.write('@' + entry.getType().getName() + '{');\n\n        HashSet<String> writtenFields = new HashSet<>();\n\n        writeKeyField(entry, out);\n        writtenFields.add(BibtexEntry.KEY_FIELD);\n\n        // Write required fields first.\n        // Thereby, write the title field first.\n        boolean hasWritten = writeField(entry, out, \"title\", false);\n        writtenFields.add(\"title\");\n\n        if (entry.getRequiredFields() != null) {\n            List<String> requiredFields = getRequiredFieldsSorted(entry);\n            for (String value : requiredFields) {\n                if (!writtenFields.contains(value)) { // If field appears both in req. and opt. don't repeat.\n                    hasWritten = hasWritten | writeField(entry, out, value, hasWritten);\n                    writtenFields.add(value);\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\n        // Then optional fields\n        if (entry.getOptionalFields() != null) {\n            List<String> optionalFields = getOptionalFieldsSorted(entry);\n            for (String value : optionalFields) {\n                if (!writtenFields.contains(value)) { // If field appears both in req. and opt. don't repeat.\n                    hasWritten = hasWritten | writeField(entry, out, value, hasWritten);\n                    writtenFields.add(value);\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\n        // Then write remaining fields in alphabetic order.\n        TreeSet<String> remainingFields = new TreeSet<>();\n        for (String key : entry.getAllFields()) {\n            boolean writeIt = write ?

Thus, it stabilized and the issue can be closed.\n\nMinor remark: The file has been recognized as BibLaTeX even though with the `@comment` it should have been BibTeX. I had to insert `@Comment{jabref-meta: DATABASE_TYPE:BibTeX;}` manually and reopen the file in JabRef to be able to investigate that behavior. - Don't know, how to deal with it, but since no one complains, it's also OK for me.\n =||= @koppor I encounters this issue when I open a bibtex file in JabRef v2.7.1, v2.10 and the latest v3.6.

I thought this was primarily the right click menu, but indeed I did add the Converters class which clearly needs testing.\n\nHowever, I had an issue which I think relates to that the JabRef preferences are not accessed. It seems like Globals.prefs is not activated during testing. As such I had to add a bit of logic to check for this, which I guess in general is good, but actually running JabRef I assume it will always be non-null.

Good idea. But you will have to move the LayoutFormatter interface as well. As our goal is that the logic Package does not have any imports from the GUI package.
